00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.980
Hillstate, which is on a losing streak but is preparing for a spring of hope, and the Kings, who are at the bottom of the check, are looking for new hope with a leap in the second half of the year

2
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:24.500
We will play the match between Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction and GS Caltex in the sixth round of the Dodram 2024-2025 v-League Women's Division with Park Mi-hee Art Institute. How are you? Hello, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is currently in the third place with three consecutive losses. We have five more games to play today

3
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:38.100
Rather than any game about the season, I feel like I'm preparing for spring volleyball. That's right. Hyundai, who prepared for spring volleyball by taking proper rest and performance, took a break from the last game, but as you warmed up normally today, overall

4
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.400
I expect that the players who originally participated will participate normally. That's right. GS Caltex won only one game in 18 games in the first half

5
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.580
Currently, he has won seven games in 13 games in the second half.

6
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.680
I think I'd like to do more seasons. I know. It's very

7
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.380
GS Caltex was the only one who was so happy in the second half that it felt like the season was short

8
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.480
But the young players' performance in the rest of the game

9
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.080
I need to raise it up a little bit and prepare for next year.

10
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.280
That's right. The two teams are expected to do their best today

11
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880
It will be the last regular season showdown.

12
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
So let's take a look at the rankings so far. Director Jung and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction are 3 points apart

13
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.280
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has now played one less game. Today, if

14
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.780
If you get 3 points, the points can now be the same as 6 points.

15
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.780
GS Caltex is also

16
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.780
4 rounds, 5 rounds, 3 wins each

17
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.780
Of course, GS Caltex was evaluated as a weak player.

18
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.280
Ziman is at the end of the standings, so he beats Pepper Savings

19
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.680
I think it's going to be a goal to raise the ranking

20
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.080
Two things. No matter how much we practice

21
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.880
The practice is as good as the actual game

22
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.080
Since there's no such thing, I need to value each and every game. That's right.

23
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.380
Yes, the two teams have 4 wins and 1 loss. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is leading

24
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.680
I can see it, but the 5th round is GS

25
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.580
Tess wins

26
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.380
Here we go. Last game

27
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.780
In the match against the Korea Expressway Corporation, I used the players evenly

28
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.480
It was a game where the players took a break and the fans were quite satisfied. That's right.

29
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.480
We lost the game

30
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.480
It's been a while since Hwang Hyunjoo came out and scored a lot with 19 points

31
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.080
Another outsider

32
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.380
Since there is no Wi-Fi player in Peter's part, how much can he get while putting Seo Ji-hye in the real game

33
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.780
These things seem to be very positive. That's right. It was the last game where we gained a lot of things.

34
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.880
GS Caltex won three games in four rounds and five rounds

35
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.580
I won the first round of the 6th round. Now

36
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.080
The point difference between the 6th place Pepper Savings Bank is now 4 points

37
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.680
Both teams are in a good mood, so I think I'll have to see you until the end.

38
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.680
It hurts my pride that 67 is competing, but from the perspective of the players

39
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.480
We'll prepare for the next season by playing every game

40
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.480
I think it will be a good opportunity to do it.

41
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.280
That's right. If GS Caltex wins today, it can make a winning streak.

42
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.280
We got off to a pretty good start again in the last game.

43
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.680
February 18th was the most recent

44
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.980
GS Caltex is the set score for the showdown in Seoul

45
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.080
3

46
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.080
In all four previous showdowns, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction won a 3-0 shutdown

47
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.080
That's right. GS Cal, who didn't get a single set until the 4th round

48
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.380
The misset in the 5th round

49
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.380
What stands out the most is the last one

50
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.080
We won by a score of 15 to 6

51
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.600
I got a pleasant victory. That's right.

52
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:38.000
How will today's game play out? Ahead of the game, I met with Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction coach Kang Seo-young and GS Caltex coach Lee Young-taek.

53
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:53.800
In that game, the main players have some sleeping injuries and physicality, so many players take a break and go into the port for the first time

54
00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:02.840
We played the game, and the breathing inside was better than I thought. I think I was able to see that kind of passion. We also

55
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:17.580
I'm going to play three matches where I can play as the best member. If there are good situations, I think it would be good to go to second place. If I go to the bad side, I'll be able to complete my physical strength

56
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.800
I'm trying to prepare for the playoffs. I'm going to take a break from a game and I'm feeling better, so I'm going to start as a full member

57
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:39.940
The fifth round of GS was also a good match, but the result was a bit disappointing, but I think there was a bit of physicality. As we didn't lose, I hope we can make a good move inside the court today.

58
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:49.360
As the players recover from injuries, that part seems to be coming out consistently with their performance. In the second half of the year, the players

59
00:05:49.440 --> 00:06:03.120
I think I've bounced back well, so I've been complimenting the players and saying a lot of good things. Until the end of the season, I'm going to continue to play with the members who are playing without any injuries.

60
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:14.460
For now, I'm going to keep the starting list as it is. I'm going to operate it that way with the intention of taking the replacement more flexibly depending on the economic situation. Right now

61
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:28.840
I think it's more important to keep what we're doing than our strategy, and since the season is just around the corner, I hope both teams finish the game safely without injury.

62
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:36.200
This is the last face-off between Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction and GS Caltex this season. I'll be back in a couple of minutes. This is the Suwon gym.

63
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:55.160
I'm sorry. It's not that bad. I'm a little bloated. It's not that bad. No, let's not endure that bad. Let's start with Tangerine Posel

64
00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:09.980
Why do you think a dodram is the first place? Experts keep the freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. 1st place to make Dodra rice paddies. Meister's favorite flavor. A dollar

65
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:25.020
Oh, you're Green Bia, too. You have to take care of your breakfast. That's right. Nutrition balance is important, and you need to pay attention to your sugar level. It's so delicious for me. Healthcare Downstream Nutrition, Refined Food, Green via

66
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:39.880
Are our adults doing well? I want to go home Where is it? I'll cheer for you. All adults in the world, Rispel Job Korea, Albamon.

67
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:57.480
This is Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction and GS Caltex, which are meeting for the last time this season. Today, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is joined by Ko Hye-rim, Yang Hyo-jin, Moma, Jung Ji-yoon, Lee Da-hyun, Kim Da-in, and Libero Kim Yeon-koung in Outsider, and GS Caltex is joined by Yoo So-yeon in Outsider

68
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.760
Oh Se-hyun, Silva, Kwon Min-ji, Ddoi Kim Ji-won, and Ibero Han Soo-jin will go first.

69
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.700
Both teams are preparing for today's game as the best members.

70
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.560
Both Moma and Silva will start from number 3.

71
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:28.340
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, which used a lot of backup players in the last game, sent out the players who had previously started first today. GS Caltex is the best member as always.

72
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:42.520
If the players of both teams are too conscious of injuries, they are losing their concentration on the game, so I want them to focus only on the game. These are referee Nam Young-soo and deputy referee Jeon Young-ha, Kim Kyung-min, Lee Myung-hyun, and Lee Ho-kyu.

73
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.120
Games Commissioner Bang Shin-bong and referee Jung Yoo-hyun will also join the game.

74
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:57.720
Silva is currently scoring 848 points. The gap with the 23rd place has already widened quite a bit.

75
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:12.760
Furthermore, Silva is currently the top scorer despite playing about four games less than Victoria. He is also a Silva who has some pride in scoring first, and he also passed his first score last year.

76
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:20.800
After the game, Silva has never been named the MVP of the round

77
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:35.300
Three Best Seven I think I'm looking forward to it a little bit. It's a living legend. Flower deer player Hwang Hyun-joo showed his still strong performance by recording a 50% attack success rate of 19 points in the last game.

78
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:50.340
First of all, from Hyundai's point of view, the atmosphere has improved. And because you ran hard, the players prepared better. In many ways, I lost the last game, but I think it was a game with a lot of income. That's right. The first set will begin. Cut from the center of Kim Hyun-kyung's Rishi.

79
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.620
He's on the right

80
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.600
How is it? Is it covered? Here we go again. It's sticking together.

81
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:10.880
It creates four block-out points. I took care of it well. Although Kim Ji-hyun's toss was Selva, Silva handled it well in the head fight with Jung Ji-hoon.

82
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.100
Lee Il-hwa is a player who somehow scores again. It's going to be a score of 1:0.

83
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.340
Way to go, SO JIN. Beg

84
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.060
Yoo Se-hyun,

85
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.440
It's Kwon Minji's consecutive hit block out.

86
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.120
I got hit by the hand and left. Yes

87
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:45.860
From Hyundai's point of view, there is a chance for players to use their strength today and there will be another game. Yes, if I make a careful prediction, I think it will be next week's Jeonggwanjangjeon.

88
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.420
It hurts with my cheeks sticking together

89
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.340
Coach out. That's right.

90
00:10:54.440 --> 00:11:00.260
First of all, Kim Da-in doesn't look towards Moma, but towards Jung Ji-hoon

91
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:09.340
I'm going to try it. Of course, it would be good for Hyundai E&amp;C players to win, but I need to pay more attention to the content and process of this game, not to win.

92
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.900
The score is two to one.

93
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:30.160
I keep it alive and sleep again. What's interesting about Kwon Min-bi is that the centers of both teams have foreign players. Yes, I'm giving a ball to a domestic player right now.

94
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:38.840
Kim Ji-won also handed the ball to Kwon Min-ji and faced off like this to the players who are making big attacks.

95
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.420
1 point sounds good.

96
00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:58.660
When I saw Moma practicing, she was quite light. That's what I'm saying. When Hyundai first started the season, it went low to make a little change. At the same time, Moma was very difficult, but the height is okay now.

97
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.200
3

98
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.520
The reception went well.

99
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:06.740
Piggy Play

100
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.480
After receiving Kim Ji-won, I see Han Soo-jin Silva. 3 strokes

101
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:20.880
This is important. The RBI made good use of his knee. Yes

102
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:34.740
They tied the score 3 to 3. Because they continue to play each other, Jung Kyu-yoon grabbed seven Silva championships out of the five games. Yes, the serve was long.

103
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.320
The score is 4 to 3

104
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:49.580
Now, it's Silva getting ready to serve. Silva is at the top of the serve. He has scored 50 serve points this season.

105
00:12:53.060 --> 00:13:04.460
I'm shaking with the fighting flesh. Did Mom leave? It's out. Oh, it's out of the way.

106
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:17.820
It's a good try. First of all, in order to cut off Silva's good serve at once, it is true that Kim Da-yoon goes inside his body when the opportunity comes. This was a ball that I hit so well, but it came off. The score is 5 to 32 points

107
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:24.780
It's live-by serve again.

108
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.260
Let's move on. Direct car

109
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.180
Kwon Min-chi. Now, Shiva has relaxed well and Kwon Min-ji has not missed this.

110
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.360
I'm director Hwang Se-young requesting operation time.

111
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:53.760
If you give them things like that easily, it's hard to copy. That toss was okay. It's not like Stray Kids, but it's easy

112
00:13:53.840 --> 00:14:08.580
When they're done quickly, you have to look at this situation on the left side. The defensive player doesn't hit hard if it's not right. The reactions need to come quickly

113
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:23.760
It was director Kang Seo-young's story to prepare a little more for the opponent's consecutive hits. And Silva has just started the second set, so it's right to go strong when he has a lot of stamina left. Yes

114
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.940
GS Caltex is leading by three points.

115
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.700
Silva at the top of the scoreboard and serve

116
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.460
Again.

117
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:47.480
Jung Ji-hyun Park Go mobile attack Lee Da-hyun was defended.

118
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.080
Park Min-jae's spike

119
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.520
Jeong Jiyoon takes the defense from the back

120
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.700
Silva saved it. It's Taewon's ball. Hit

121
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.820
It's going to be a cover. Han Soojin

122
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.300
As it is, to Silva

123
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.500
It's a success.

124
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:12.020
I lost the ball. That's what I'm saying. The timing was good, but I got hit on the cheek before my hand went in perfectly. Silva is on the side

125
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:25.420
I thought the ball was in front of me, but it was handled well. I ordered a bound, but I lost the ball momentarily and couldn't save it. Silva's credit is very strong. Yes

126
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.380
The live-action sub continues. Kim Hyun-kyung

127
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.840
No. 1's air is good. It's a success. Yes

128
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:42.860
The tempo attack that made a difference was well done and Silva defended aggressively. Yes

129
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:52.660
7

130
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.740
The master was long.

131
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:03.620
In the end, it's 8-4, and we're facing the first technical timeout of the first set. This is Suwon.

132
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:20.820
Oh, you're Green Bia, too. You have to take care of your breakfast. That's right. Nutrition and balance are important, so you have to pay attention to sugar content. I feel reassured. It's so delicious. Downstream Nutritional Foods in Health Care

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.900
GS Caltex with 50% team attack success rate without fault

139
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.500
The game will continue with Kwon Min-jae's serve.

140
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.000
It's like this. Yes

141
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:31.260
Both teams are making mistakes on their serve. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction did the best in both offensive breaking serve when meeting GS. Right, Hyundai was the best part in breaking up to GS

142
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.220
Neither team is good. To the back of Kwon Minji's reception

143
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.300
It's sold to Yoshihyun on the other side of Han Soo-jin. "Break."

144
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.360
It's 3 strokes

145
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:56.400
Twist it in the opposite river and hit it. That's right. It's important to attract enough players to the opposite side, Ko Ye-rim. At this time, this player's role is very important in the run-up to the attack. That's right.

146
00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.100
We have a good attack. 862, two points

147
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:07.720
Han Soojin's receiving came down a little bit. Right grilling, consecutive hits

148
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.300
I'm in defense.

149
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.900
I'm going to turn it over for now. Minji Kwon changed her position and scored four points to Ryu So-yeon

150
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:26.580
These are GS Caltex players who are putting the paint very properly. GS Caltex is enjoying some fun with consecutive hits. Yes, then modern athletes

151
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:34.040
We need to quickly respond to defense and prepare for consecutive hits. It's nine to six. the book of Ddui

152
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.680
It was long.

153
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:49.580
Here comes the sub mistake again. There are certain types of mistakes depending on the game on the day of the game. I think I need to put it a little short overall because I have a long serve in general today.

154
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.980
Kim Da-in getting ready to serve

155
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.080
It was hard to pass. I saved it.

156
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.540
It became FOMO.

157
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.120
Oh, I saved one more hit. I'm ready for Silva

158
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.900
Hit the right hole

159
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.980
Block out has been declared. Let me check. Okay

160
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.820
Coach Hwang Seo-young asks for a video review as the players say it wasn't right.

161
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:35.120
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction team requested a video review of the broker touch. If this is out

162
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.740
That's what I'm saying.

163
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:44.780
And the RBI was good and the location was very good. It's been confirmed. How do you get away with it like that? Yes, that's what I'm saying.

164
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.120
It was out as it was, and now it's 9 to 81 points.

165
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.600
I want to give you a score. Yes, I agree. Yes

166
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.940
Let's move on by hitting Kim Da-in's sub-net again. It's floating fast and Oh Se-hyun is blocked.

167
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:18.680
Yang Hyo-jin's Blocking Scores Since four or two players were in front of him, Kim Jae-hyun has to play golf ball more leisurely. It was tied at 9 to 9. Yang Hyo-jin defended it correctly.

168
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:30.720
Kim Da-in, the ace who turned the tables on his serve

169
00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:38.860
In the end, head coach Lee Young-taek has no choice but to bring the players together. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction succeeded in turning the tables.

170
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
It was too strong. It flowed into me and it was short

171
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:53.200
Not the hand that pulls the ball towards the road, but the 5 minutes of the serve that flies the other way

172
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.100
I was good at it

173
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:02.640
I shouldn't search it.

174
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:16.640
Director Lee Young-taek also said at the end that it was cut off due to a good atmosphere mistake. Yes 7 vs 38 vs 4 the score was flipped in an instant and in that situation they are giving up points on the easiest breaking and serve. Yes

175
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.940
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction tied the game with a block and made a turnaround with a serve.

176
00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.000
Kim Da-in continued to serve.

177
00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.100
KWON MIN JI and KIM JI WON's background

178
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.580
a right guard.

179
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.540
Yes, it's possible.

180
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.600
10

181
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:46.560
Silva's speed is very good today. Yes

182
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.760
He scored by beating Blocker completely.

183
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:07.260
I followed Han Soo-jin's dig in the middle, so I saved it for now. I'm handing it over. After receiving Yang Hyo-jin's obind, he's out again.

184
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:24.920
In modern times, this has to fit. This kind of good defense came out when the decision was the best. Yes, it's today, but I fell and got out.

185
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:37.180
11

186
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.060
It was the same course again, but you're out.

187
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:52.280
You're attacking in place. Time difference attack. This was a very big attack, so I think it would have been nice to see it a little longer. Yes.

188
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.680
There were two attack mistakes. 12 to 10

189
00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.000
One.

190
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.700
Body, Pike came in.

191
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.900
My body is fine today. Yes

192
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:19.680
From Kim Da-in's point of view, he used another player at the beginning and took a break for one game. Yes. I'll boost my sense of play first, and after the important middle, I'll probably have more balls to go to Moa.

193
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.100
Drop it in the Line Park where you came from Batters.

194
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:38.060
13

195
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.340
13

196
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.200
Shake it.

197
00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.520
I saw this team for a long time, but it was defended.

198
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.760
Block out.

199
00:23:52.680 --> 00:24:03.440
GS Caltex 14 vs 11. Already 5 points over 50 50% success rate. Director Jang Seo-yeon has his head out like this and asks for operation time.

200
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:18.580
Bring the mood and watch it. We're going to make mistakes again. We can't do well except for the side out anyway. The counterattack is the second time. So I think it's important how fast we turn when we do Rishi. When we fight back, we'll practice a little lower

201
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.440
I saw it coming and it's all inside. My wish is to go New Year's Eve

202
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.260
All right. Hurry up and find out

203
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:43.520
In terms of this season's record, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction also ranks first with 4.3 centan errors. After the second half, there are more than five. There are already five mistakes in Gyeonggi Province today

204
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:50.940
And with the mistakes included, yes. He's giving up a three-point lead.

205
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.920
the service of Yoshiyeon

206
00:24:54.220 --> 00:25:08.800
Risp is shaking. With Koo Hye-rim on top, Jung Ji-hoon is off. It's a punching bag. This is important. This is because it is not easy to play unless Jung Joon-hyun already makes up for the burden of sub-receiving with an attack.

207
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.980
It's also very important when you're beating them up. So, we're going to meet you in spring volleyball

208
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.620
Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. and Jeong Kwan-jang have a much stronger serve. Yes, that’s right.

209
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:33.280
Yang Hyo-jin will come out for a while, and Han Min-woo will go in and serve. Han Soo-jin received it and saved the tombstone.

210
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.500
I followed him to Hanmi and lifted him up. Body out bike

211
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:52.840
Good blocking came out. Kwon In-ji's blocked goal mom should also give more length with the idea that there are higher players than Kwon Min-jae for the same ball. Yes. 15 to 12

212
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.100
Oh Se-young

213
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:07.160
It's shaking. It takes care of it quickly. Microphone touch out. Yes. Touch out has been declared.

214
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.560
I couldn't avoid it, but yes, that's right. The ball is out. Yes.

215
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.140
Kwon Min-ji, who was defending, got hit in the head. Yes

216
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.860
Oh my, I hope you get my serve well

217
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.040
I'll hit you. Okay

218
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:36.840
The live-by score made it 16-13. This is the second technical timeout of the first set. This is Suwon.

219
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.180
It's a waste of me to eat something else.

220
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:19.500
Why it's cheese? It's not like Pradak chicken. It's a little bloated. Pharmacy is not that bad. No, it's just enough to eat gelphosel

221
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:24.980
Let's not endure heartburn and bloating all at once and start right away. Tangerine posel

222
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:43.400
Now it's a showdown between Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, which has to prepare for the postseason playoffs, and GS Caltex, which wants a good finish by the sixth round of the second half. GS Caltex leads Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction by 3 points with 16 to 13

223
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.700
Silva still has a 60% offensive winning percentage of his six points in today's game.

224
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.720
Jung Ji-hoon and Kim Da-in come down and upload them.

225
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.740
I saved it. Yes, I'm Kim Chaewon.

226
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:16.040
Still, the serve to Jung Ji-hoon is going very well, and he is receiving a lot of Jung Ji-hoon today. I wondered if Silva would use her feet. Yes, yes, yes

227
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.300
16 to 142 points

228
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.200
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction now has Ko Min-ji come in and serve.

229
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.080
The reception went well.

230
00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:40.200
Push it in with both hands. The goal was too low and this was processive, but from Hyundai's point of view, this is also a mistake. Yes.

231
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.020
The goal that comes out of the body

232
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:56.560
It's been handled well. If you look at Kim Ji-won's mouth after tossing, you felt it right now. Let's toss Kim Ji-won. Let's toss Kwon Min-ji. Yoo Ah-ram is here.

233
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.560
I have four serve points this season. Hold it inside

234
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.660
Do you check now? You're checking it once.

235
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:26.340
You have requested a video review of the in-out. It's a video review request about whether to turn it in or out. Yes, yes

236
00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:31.860
As a result of selection, it has been confirmed as out.

237
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.200
It's out of the way.

238
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.860
But every time Yoo Ah-ram comes in, he does one thing

239
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:48.160
He's a player who goes out. Yes sets are left. It's Cho Dae-hwan, who was quite disappointed. Now, there's a two point difference

240
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.960
It's out.

241
00:29:51.260 --> 00:30:05.580
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has a lot of sub-homekits today. You have to think about this, too. Compared to other gyms, trust is blowing a lot of things inside

242
00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:09.140
It's turning. Yes, it's going around, so I think we need to take this into account.

243
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.700
Walk to the left. I'd love to.

244
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:27.240
Ko Hye-rin is light today. That's right. The speed of the attack like this was so fast that I felt like I was really hitting the ball and Kim Da-hyun's toss was also very accurate. That's right.

245
00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:33.060
When Ko Hye-rim is good at attacking, her form is coming out. 18 to 16

246
00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.200
back-to-back hits with Lee Ju-hwa

247
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.760
But you can't do it alone. I saw one hand running out.

248
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.840
Success! A great attack came out. Yes

249
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.720
I love watching these rookies. Yes

250
00:30:53.260 --> 00:31:03.900
Lee Ju-hwan also said this year was his first year, so to play properly next season, we need to show the last six rounds of this season. Yes, that’s right.

251
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.660
While falling down, Ritchie is the center mason, Yang Hyojin

252
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:19.200
When Yang Hyo-jin receives serve, he goes in from behind, so he can make a powerful attack.

253
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:29.400
You have to keep this position even when you get off. It was Jang Hyunjin's first attack score in today's game. The De

254
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.120
19 to 181 points

255
00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:48.820
Go Hye-rim and Go Hye-rim's attack and defensive serve also gave them strength. Tyout Gis Caltex Yerim pushed it now, so the ball is falling off a little faster. You have to judge it quickly

256
00:31:49.220 --> 00:32:00.660
It falls off easily. And if it's hard, she hits it too fast, so Jisoo needs to do it a little faster. I'll get a seat and it won't fall out

257
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:12.820
It was the current time for head coach Lee Young-taek, who was mainly talking about Koo Hye-rim's serve ball and timing.

258
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:24.860
It's early days, but Ko Hye-rim's attack and serve's performance are very good news for Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, which is set for spring volleyball. Of course. Yes, player Yoo Ah-ram

259
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.200
Three.

260
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.820
I'm Ko Yoon, who has a 50% success rate for the third generation today.

261
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.240
Please move to the left

262
00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:53.160
Yang Hyo-jin's tie blocker didn't look anywhere else, but Yang Hyo-jin was only looking at Silva. The perfect blocking of the pitcher's loss came out. 19 to 19 and eventually tied the game again.

263
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.440
Director Lee Young-taek will now remove Lee Ju-hwan and put Ryu So-yeon back in.

264
00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:05.320
First of all, one sub reception is important. Oh, it was long.

265
00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.340
20s and 19s

266
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:26.300
It is necessary to quickly organize the idea that the players generally have longer balls than they think. Yes, it's GS Caltex, which leads by one point again. Let's make it short

267
00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.240
Kim Yeon Gyeon who saves her life

268
00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:39.380
He's out of Moi-id again. Kim Hyun-kyung is out this time. Yang Hyojin is out.

269
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:44.840
There are too many mistakes of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction in the first set. There are eight. Yes

270
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:57.900
Three of them were Yang Yoo-jae's attacks and the course was very good. It was hard to tie, but two points of emotion are made again.

271
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:03.260
It's up to you to push the hit.

272
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.060
It's on the straight side of Kang Vinci.

273
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:12.700
Dig's attack that is good enough for director Lee Young-taek to clench his hands

274
00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:25.420
This was a very fast move by SK players. Yes, so GS Caltex is not scoring in the center, but Kwon Min-ji is now playing his part on the other side of your Silva. That's right.

275
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.740
Both players have six points each.

276
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.940
It's long now. Min-ah, Ducky out, Se-hyun scored.

277
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.260
In Anyang

278
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:50.540
If Oh Se-hyun looked at the back and put it in, he improved a lot during this season, and yes, if he went by mistake, it's something to think about, but yes, the result was good anyway. GS Caltex 23-19 with 4 consecutive points.

279
00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.880
Once again, Kwon Minji

280
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:18.220
2

281
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:29.320
You've entered the bar.

282
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:42.560
24

283
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.180
This is a set of sand points from GS Caltex.

284
00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.400
Oh Subin will come in and serve.

285
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.820
I'm going to fall down and do this Shiv Direct. Yes

286
00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:09.200
This is how the first set ends. Set 1 GS Caltex takes it 25 to 20. GS Caltex had a very high attack success rate and played a very salty hundred while minimizing vacancy.

287
00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:15.220
The away team GS Caltex will take the first set. We'll continue the broadcast with this set in a little while. This is the Suwon gym.

288
00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.760
Because your dreams are higher than the high walls of reality

289
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:50.420
From start-ups to star companies, are we all missing Zew sugar so that a tomorrow full of fighting hope can be opened?

290
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:59.000
No way. I added protein Zero sugar, zero cholesterol, zero sugar, plus protein

291
00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.380
Genu Stevia Protein Coffee Mix

292
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:20.800
Won. Won is

293
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:33.140
Like me, we wanted to be DOYOUNG and our members for that life

294
00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:37.180
What's more surprising is that from now on

295
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.480
I don't want to eat anything else

296
00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:55.300
Why It's Cheese? Pradak Chicken Uh is also Greenvia. You have to take care of your breakfast. That's right. It's important to have a nutritional balance. And

297
00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:06.120
You have to pay attention to him, too. I feel reassured. I'm so delicious. Downstream Nutrition Greenvia Do you know why Dodraman money is the number one?

298
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:18.280
Experts keep the freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. Meister who makes a lot of money with a board. My favorite flavor board and a lot of money

299
00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:25.680
GS Caltex brought the first set against Gyeonggi Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction today.

300
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:40.700
The difference in error was large, and the difference in attack success rate was also large. That's right. In the middle, Lee Da-yeon and Yang Hyun-jin usually take up nearly 20% of the share and give up as many points, but they can hardly score today

301
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:51.280
If it's a little disappointing, then we need to change our minds a little more about how Kim Da-hyun should solve the play or whether he should lean a little more toward Moba.

302
00:38:51.360 --> 00:39:04.020
That's right. Jung Ji-hoon and Moma scored four points each, Silva scored seven and Kwon Min-gyu scored six points. Yang Hyo-jin scored three points in the first set, but he scored only one point on offense and had a success rate of only 14%.

303
00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.700
And there were three mistakes.

304
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:18.280
Juice Caltex brought the first set with the power of both wings. Yes, as the starting player lost a point, Kwon Min-ji scored 6 points

305
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:24.320
He is increasing the score in attack. The second set will begin with Ko Hyerim's serve.

306
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.740
Hello.

307
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.760
The lychee is shaking.

308
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.280
I'm blocked by this by-open.

309
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:43.060
Today's blocking score is Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, which is making 4 points now. It's Jung Ji Yoon's blocking right now.

310
00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:51.840
The current position is the highest. The score is 1:0 again. Kim Jiwon moves a lot.

311
00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.660
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Starts Second Set With Back-to-Back Blocking Scores

312
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:10.920
Solo blocking is successful.

313
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.500
Back up, Rishi

314
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.280
Get a consecutive hit

315
00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.140
They fall while holding Han and Jo Ji-hoon, making it 3 to 0.

316
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:35.340
GS Caltex succeeded in attack while handling it quickly, and in order to continue the atmosphere of the first step, our first serve needs to be done better. I'm director Lee Young-taek of GS Caltex, who is requesting the operation time immediately.

317
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:53.940
This block is the highest. You can't just get it live. You can draw it while putting it on the groove. As I said before, the one where you hit it is short

318
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.920
I said I'm going to go quickly

319
00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:10.120
Players say that high balls should not come because the opponent's height is the highest. And one of the reasons why Silva had a high chance of success in the first set was

320
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:20.400
There were a lot of thin balls in the set rather than high balls right now. That's right. In today's blocking, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is leading by 5 to 1.

321
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.380
I'm blocked.

322
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.560
It's near Yoon Seo-yeon. I saved the ball in a row

323
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.680
Jeongju-ri Spike

324
00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.640
As you fall down

325
00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.380
Can I hit you?

326
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.100
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction cannot be king due to threats.

327
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:47.220
Kwon Min-ji supported him from the back. One more time, Silva Kaica

328
00:41:47.520 --> 00:42:01.440
It's going through. Kwon Min-soo positioned the dig so well, and yes, I was good at this, but Kim Soo-hyun's back pitching at the end was very good.

329
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.820
Silva's score made it 3 to 1.

330
00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.960
Kim Eun-kyung

331
00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.160
Jung Ji-hoon, whose left side comes in, is a success.

332
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:28.100
Jung Ji-hoon is making the most points in the team today. It's good to cut it short and hit it. Yes

333
00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:37.160
Jung Ji-hoon is also quite good at attacking the time difference and today's attack success rate is reaching 50%. Silva is the receiver.

334
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.020
It's in the front, but I saved it. Kim Jihwan

335
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.040
There's a traffic jam.

336
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.200
Once again, MOMA scored a block

337
00:42:51.960 --> 00:43:06.220
Oma was keeping the straight line well. Yes, Kim Ji-hyun needs to be more bold about these balls. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is leading by 4 points

338
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.940
a girl's two-tiered connection.

339
00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:13.080
Kwon Minji, block out.

340
00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:28.460
Still, Kwon Min-ji has 7 points. Two players, Kwon Min-ji and Jung Ji-yoon, are doing quite well today. Lee Da-yeon got hit and scored a block out

341
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.020
The gap is three points apart

342
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.760
Go Yerim

343
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:53.920
So today's game is... Jung Ji-hoon and Ko Ye-rim are definitely showing their form when they're good. That's right. And Kim Da-in also trusts these two players and gives them a lot of balls. Yes, this single tooth is also good.

344
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.600
6

345
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.180
I received it well. It's

346
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.980
The two players have a very fast timing for this stonemason.

347
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:18.880
Yemoma's very good serve was exactly connected. It is 2 with a 50% success rate of stonemasonry. It's ranked second in stonemasonry.

348
00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.880
Silva by three points

349
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.960
LEE DAE HYUN, please do it faster

350
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.020
Jung Ji-hoon did a good job. I couldn't move and breathe well.

351
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.440
It's on the right.

352
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:49.540
A cool attack came out as he aimed at the course so well as if he were measuring himself. Yes, the timing wasn't right here Yes, yes. At times like that

353
00:44:49.620 --> 00:45:01.820
You have to decide whether to hit him in the back or move forward. Now, I ask for operation time. Director Kang Sung Hyun always said, "I can't miss the timing of your pipe."

354
00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:09.580
You posted the difficult one well. Does this mean we have to go back or if the story doesn't match the timing, we have to go both ways. I mean, I have to go to you.

355
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:22.900
It's twisted here, but it's good and you can't do that. It's also strong. You have to go back when it's strong. We went well in the beginning. You brought the flow well. So the part that's a little more cold is to be cold. Okay, okay. Let's do it

356
00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:38.000
He also said that the attack on the central arc using Moma should fit a little better, and if it doesn't work, show some flexibility. Usually now, there's no problem when you toss and the center moves forward. But

357
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:44.540
There is a high probability of hitting when the movement after tossing is back again. Right? Yes.

358
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.220
Closer to two points of counterattack.

359
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:54.540
We got along well with each other for a short period of time, except for Oma

360
00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:09.540
Cameron Bomber Moma, who overcame his 184-centimeter-tall rise in the past thousand times behind the attack line with elasticity and skill, scored a thousand points in his second career issue of all time.

361
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.280
He is the first player to score a thousand backward points. That's right.

362
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:22.440
Block out has been declared. Nicely done. To tell you more about Moma, he's 130

363
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:36.360
Four games. That's right. That's one point. Hwang Hyun-joo is now the number one escort with 1,254 points, but the actual success is now 970. That's right. That's because there's already been an attack by two points. That's right.

364
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:40.480
7

365
00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.640
I got hit by a stonemason, but because of the score

366
00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:56.600
I need to change my mood. Big Maa also scored, so it should be a good opportunity to try a little more next time. This is the first technical timeout of the second set. This is Suwon.

367
00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.440
Compass of Korea's Health

368
00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:05.680
Korea's First Stomach Health Double Formulation Will Peony

369
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.860
I'm going to take care of my stomach's health

370
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:18.120
As expected, it's an outpatient on the top.

371
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.420
It's a waste of me to eat something else.

372
00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:39.780
The reason why it's cheese is that only Pradak Chicken Zew sugar is missing? I don't think so? I added protein Zero sugar, zero cholesterol, zero sugar, add protein, and chow

373
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:42.280
Stevia protein coffee mix

374
00:47:45.700 --> 00:48:00.700
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, which gave up the first set, is gaining strength in the second set. He's leading by 3 points with 8 to 5. Along with his team's good flow, Moma also made his first career back-scoring. It's Lee Da Yeon's serve.

375
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.880
It's coming in briefly. Here we go. Lee Seoyeon's score

376
00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.820
The score is 8 to 6

377
00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.300
Clever score. Yes

378
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.820
If you try to go too hard, there's a high chance you'll get caught

379
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:22.800
GS Caltex continues to have a good team attack success rate in 12 sets now.

380
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.000
Jeong Jiyoon

381
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.880
I pushed it out as it is.

382
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:43.920
That's good. I took care of it well. Yes, overnet is actually a very sensitive part for players. That's right. So the play might shrink a little, but yes, I handled it well.

383
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.040
Silva and Ryu Soyeon's comic play

384
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.800
It's a 1-point gap

385
00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:57.100
Yang Hyojin fell in the middle and live by pig

386
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.020
Lee Seo Hyun. Yes, it's a success.

387
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:13.780
In the second set, Ryu So-yeon comes out again. Shinman defended Yang Hyo-jin's paint too well. Yes, maybe that's why I'm encouraging the players because they're better than when they attack. Eight to eight

388
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:20.360
We tied the game. Yes, Yoseoyeon, who ran scared

389
00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:33.680
It's out. There's a mistake coming out. Yes, look. If Yang Hyo-jin and Lee Da-yeon don't score

390
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:44.400
This unreasonable attack comes out because Oh Se-hyun or Tui started in advance and the exact timing went. Yes, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is the 9th one

391
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.240
So this attack is out, too. That's what I'm saying. Spilling out the home room. Yes

392
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.660
Eventually, we request a second operation time in the early hours.

393
00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.160
Some of these are our rules our law

394
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:21.900
When I was in that room, I turned around when it got weak, and that's what I was disappointed about. What's unfortunate about this is the difference. Over there and us

395
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:41.920
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction also won more than four games until the third round, but in the fourth round, three wins and five rounds, they are now losing the first game of the second round and the sixth round.

396
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.440
Whenever a crisis comes

397
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:55.540
That's what I did, but it's a shame that the economy is unstable now

398
00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:08.060
It's cus out. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has three consecutive attack mistakes now.

399
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:20.780
Now, coach Kang Sung-hyun was planning to give the main players a proper rest while maintaining their performance, but there are a lot of bump pens today.

400
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.220
Kang Chan, score

401
00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:39.500
The reason why GS Caltex players are playing so well is that they predict and move well in advance of their opponents. Yes

402
00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:45.960
The second set is GS Caltex, where Triangle Hyundai is in operation with the addition of Yoshihyun.

403
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.500
It's a back-to-back defense

404
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.080
I saved it

405
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.440
Can I pass it? I can't turn it over.

406
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.720
It's a score of 10

407
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.580
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is making one point with difficulty.

408
00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:20.280
Rather, Hyundai is not raising the score by their own play, but by the opponent's mistakes. Yes

409
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.720
1

410
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:54.520
Silva already has a very high success rate of 10 points. Still, after Silva scored nine points, the domestic players took a lot of rest to score. I know. It's not too aggressive. Yes

411
00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.340
It's my team that leads by four points.

412
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:12.900
The serve was long. Hyundai continues to score more and more points in a row. I know. Yes, so it's become very easy for the opponent to play.

413
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.660
Go Hyerim on the serve

414
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.260
Thank you for the time. Yes, yes

415
00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:25.240
14

416
00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:41.120
Yoo So-yeon is already scoring 6 points in today's game. Since he scored one point in the first set, he is now scoring five points in the second set. And as we dig short and long into the middle, we're constantly making changes to the play. Yes

417
00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:47.040
After receiving Kim Hyun Gyun, Jung Ju Hyun's key was opened

418
00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:03.000
From the point of view of the Kim Da-in center, Yang Hyo-jin is not doing well right now, so he can't give up Yang Hyo-jin and continues to go only to the side. That's right. If so, it's getting harder to attack because the other broker is moving in advance. Yes

419
00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.160
Kwon Minji receiving

420
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.780
Hitting Silva hits it in.

421
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:23.820
And the exact ball is being delivered well. Yes. After Kim Jae-hyun's ball to Oh Se-hyun was caught by Yang Hyo-jin

422
00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:30.680
I can't give it to Kim Jae-hyun and Oh Se-hoon, but it's well delivered on both sides. That's right.

423
00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.080
15

424
00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:58.760
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, with Moma scoring 9 points today, and Jung Ji-hoon and Moma scoring 9 points each. Kwon Min-ji ran well.

425
00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:03.040
It's a Silva success while putting it up.

426
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:09.340
We are facing our second technical timeout of 16/122 sets. This is Suwon.

427
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.660
Compass of Korea's Health

428
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.920
Korea's First Stomach Health Double Formulation Will Peony

429
00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:25.120
I'm going to take care of my stomach's health

430
00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:34.440
As expected, it's an outpatient on the top. Oh, you're Green Bia, too. You have to take care of your breakfast. That's right. It's important to have a nutritional balance

431
00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:49.160
It's reassuring to take care of your sugar level. I'm so delicious. Health care downstream nutritional supplements, green vias, mugwort, hydropower, not that much. It's a little bloated. The pharmacy isn't that much. No

432
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:57.500
Let's start with Tangerine Posel instead of holding on to your stomach and feeling bloated

433
00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:14.560
GS Caltex overcame the atmosphere at the beginning of the second set and made a turnaround of 16-12. Today's team attack success rate is reaching 55%. We're going to play in a pretty good way

434
00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:22.960
The attack success rate, which was maintained at around 35% in the usual game, is much higher.

435
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.580
Silva at the top of the serve

436
00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.800
The serve is being pushed out.

437
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:40.520
GS Caltex has more than 5 mistakes per set per game, but there are only 6 mistakes so far in the middle of the second set today.

438
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:48.580
I'm taking care of my bucket. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has a problem.

439
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:55.160
Kwon Minji

440
00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:01.280
Prime Minister Hyun-ta Ko Hye-rim touched it well. These are Moba,

441
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.040
Live by Dig

442
00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:04.940
And Silva

443
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.980
It's out.

444
00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:17.480
Human was greedy. After a good defense, he signed on himself. Yes

445
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:32.360
I was confident. But it's out of the way. 16:14 Ryu Soyeon Elly is back

446
00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:47.780
Good move. Kim Jihyun's toss today is high and very fast. So I think we can take more of your share because this player has a pretty high success rate. And overall, the sub-receiving is going well today. Yes

447
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:55.260
So-hee came during the season, but she's making a pretty good performance.

448
00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:59.540
Yoo Ah-ram is here.

449
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.000
Kim Hyun-kyung

450
00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:12.440
To the left, Choi's ears were well-blued. Yes

451
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:27.340
The mid-blue is reading the process of Kim Da-in pitching in advance. It's stuck right on my right hand. GS Caltex Makes 4 Points Impressive Again

452
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:34.520
You get caught in the net. 18 to 15

453
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:48.560
Which players are the most popular in GS Caltex? Well, it's a question that I never thought of, so I'll study it a little more. Okay

454
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.580
Visual Brewing

455
00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:58.600
I'm stuck. This good breaking could be a good opportunity to change the team atmosphere a little bit. Yes

456
00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:07.980
There is no problem with Hyundai E&amp;C's blocking today. Yang Hyo-jin is also holding three blocks.

457
00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:12.580
Dear Lee Ju,

458
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:25.280
Kim Jihwan, it's Joo Kang Seok's again. This is another player who makes a score. In the first set, Silva and Kwon Min-ji accounted for most of the attacks

459
00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:39.820
Yoo So-yeon and Tui are joining the second set. That's right. Tui is a very lightweight player and his timing for stonemasons is very fast and good. Tui came out for a while and Kim Mi-hyun was put in for serve.

460
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.400
Kim Mihyun can serve in various ways

461
00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.720
You can put it in short.

462
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.840
Go Yerim

463
00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:53.880
The Dig of Kim Mi-hyun, Rome

464
00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:56.900
It's Lee Ju-hwa on the other side. Rival Spike

465
00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:10.780
It's out of drawing. It was pushed out as it was. It's because I'm too conscious of hitting. If you hit the wrist and hit the side

466
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.520
It's important to hit him quickly. You're asking for a video review.

467
01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:27.720
This is it. The Hyundai Construction team has requested a video review of the in-out. Video read request about whether to turn it in or out. Yes

468
01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:39.560
As a result of the supervision, it was confirmed to be out. Unlike Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, there are a lot of mistakes in this attack. That's right.

469
01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:45.160
The gap between 20 and 164 points is high.

470
01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:06.060
It's Kim Mi-hyun who puts in a short serve. From our perspective, the space seemed very large because there were too many defensive players in the back, and Kim Mi-hyun is a very good serve player.

471
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:19.600
Kim Mi-hyun has various sliders and changer curves. I have to go strong this time. This time, Ko Hye-rim received it. It's Yang Hyo-jin in the middle. I'm on defense

472
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.720
I passed it over.

473
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.280
Pike

474
01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.680
Go Yerim

475
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:37.920
For Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, it is not easy to make a point like this in today's game. When HYOJIN didn't make it

476
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:47.720
It's today's homework on how to solve the game. Also, they are in a position to play home volleyball, so I think those things will actually remain.

477
01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:58.420
So, there are only two offensive points in the center, which is the strength of Hyundai E&amp;C.

478
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:12.680
Of course, Yang Hyun-soo will also improve his condition, but this result is probably too inside the attack line. You need to come out a little more and make it faster to go in.

479
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:26.320
I heard more. Create a successive block-out team. In a way, it might be this easy to get 2 points, but there are times when it's too hard. Yes

480
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.980
Lee Joo-hwa joined hands and sent him out.

481
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:39.860
Kim Jae Won, a man with a family

482
01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.840
Out. Yes

483
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.440
22

484
01:02:47.940 --> 01:03:00.340
Being able to hit a straight line well has many advantages, but if there is even a little error like this, it gets out. That's right. Alicia, again

485
01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.380
Blocking as if you're moving

486
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.720
Jung Jiyoon's blocking

487
01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.580
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction closes the gap by 22 to 202 points

488
01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:21.240
And then you have to be prepared for the short fall

489
01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.080
Cho Hyunjoo, are you behind me

490
01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:48.040
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is narrowing the gap little by little. GS Caltex has only won one game so far until the third round, but it is in a pretty good mood now in the 456th round.

491
01:03:48.400 --> 01:04:02.240
In terms of the second half record alone, the number of points is 21, so it has the fourth most points among the seven clubs. That's how it works. So I was playing well enough to ask GS before Kobe was decided.

492
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:08.460
I'm Ko Hye-rim from the sand dune truck. We're going to go with 2 bodies and 1 point difference today.

493
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:19.460
It's a frosty dot as you shake it and put it in

494
01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.640
Once again,

495
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.640
It's a tie with a score.

496
01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:40.660
Ryu So-yeon is jumping out fast. So from Lee Young-taek's point of view, Lee Ju-hwa gave him a chance to endure this situation

497
01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:45.500
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, which scored five consecutive points, eventually tied the score.

498
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.880
Oh, the attacker, Siri

499
01:04:50.980 --> 01:05:01.880
Successful upset Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction became a good serve reception after three times, and in fact, this is not because Kim Ji-hyun is the problem, but because Oh Se-hyun was not preparing.

500
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.160
As the attack did not exceed the fourth inning, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is now moving forward.

501
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.580
It was a smart play. 23 to 23

502
01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:31.820
Today, Ko Hye-rim and Yoo Se-yeon are scoring 7 points each. I'm Yoshiyeon, getting ready to serve.

503
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.100
Cheer up.

504
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:39.640
The reception was shaky. It's Jung Ji-yoon's side. Ible Spike

505
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.240
It came over.

506
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.080
Quickly inside the body

507
01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.440
back-to-back hits

508
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:50.980
I'm defending and I'm going to have a chance to play again. Taka Kwon Minji

509
01:05:51.180 --> 01:06:04.780
Kwon Min-soo made such a good decision, and in fact, Kim Da-in's pitcher was too short before that, and in fact, these things determine the course of the game.

510
01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:09.120
The set point juice pat of the two sets is short. It's too short.

511
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.220
We're going to deuce.

512
01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.140
24

513
01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.300
KWON MIN JI will take it

514
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:41.740
I saved him by Barr and he's exactly fine. Moa Pike

515
01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:54.980
In the end, it's because Roman was good at attacking, but Han Mi-ri's enders fell a little and three players went. Yes

516
01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:01.740
Now Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction will receive set points.

517
01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.960
Positive touch does not make two mistakes. 25 to 25

518
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:20.200
This set is

519
01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:26.060
It's getting tight in the second half of the set. Oh Se-yeol of the serve

520
01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.480
Oh Hyerim worked hard to make it work. Spike

521
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.520
Now, we're in defense.

522
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:40.100
It's a score.

523
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:54.160
Giscatex players are doing so well behind the scenes today, and they are playing smartly without overdoing it every time the decisive ball goes up. So, it doesn't have to be Silva in this critical situation. Today

524
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:55.300
That's right.

525
01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:02.440
The risk has been shaken.

526
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.020
Moma's concentration is also reviving.

527
01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.280
The third news

528
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:18.180
A quick attack worked.

529
01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:24.120
Kim Da-in comes out and Na Hyun-soo is put in as a one-point blocker. Moma's turn to serve.

530
01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:37.140
Sit Caltex defenders need to prepare for a light serve, thinking that they have to go over it.

531
01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.680
Serve

532
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.180
Amoma makes serve points here.

533
01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.080
As expected, Moma is a player. I'm asking for a video review

534
01:08:51.280 --> 01:09:03.940
Whether he stepped on the sub-line or not, coach Lee Young-taek needed time. I requested a video review of the ANDLINE touch. Not at all. Yes, yes

535
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:07.060
There is no problem.

536
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:22.120
All right. First of all, GS Caltex needs to reduce its anxiety and put it on the attack line, and Kim Ji-hyun needs to prepare another ball that fits her. 27 to 26

537
01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:28.840
Minji lifted it up and went towards Silva

538
01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.500
That's right. Yes, yes. 27 to 27

539
01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:39.520
This is followed by a close race of Deus. Silva is a reliable player. Yes

540
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:48.180
Lee Da-yeon got hit and was out.

541
01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.800
And this time, GS Pantex is live by Sony

542
01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:01.940
It's not out

543
01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:05.220
It's out of the way.

544
01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:20.980
First of all, the course I threw to hit the serve was a little right. 28 vs. 27 I'm shaking with 10 points today.

545
01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:26.560
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction will have a chance to end it. Where is Kim Dine going?

546
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:40.960
I'm taking this set with me because it's hard to shake and GS Caltex has to play a lot of games like this. After a close game of deuce, the set score became 1 to 1 revenge.

547
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.520
We'll continue with the broadcast in three sets in a little while.

548
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.380
This is the Suwon gym.

549
01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:51.900
What's more surprising is that from now on

550
01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.200
It's a waste of me to eat something else.

551
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.280
Why it's cheese? Pradak chicken

552
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.220
3

553
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.660
Two one

554
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:50.440
Our Won is

555
01:11:50.520 --> 01:12:02.820
Just like me, I want to do what we want to do and live our lives

556
01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:14.400
Are our kids doing well today as well? I just got to work, but I'm already hungry. I miss my mom. I'm hungry. I want to go home

557
01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.000
Do you have a license card? Come on in It's okay.

558
01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:34.920
Everyone is doing well. My work is growing well, so everything I work for, everything I do in the world, respect job Korea, Albamon, and Korea's health

559
01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.340
Korea's First Stomach Health Double Formulation Will Peony

560
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.580
I'm going to take care of my stomach's health

561
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:59.500
As expected, it's an outpatient on the top. Is the sugar only missing? No way. I added protein Zero sugar, zero cholesterol, zero sugar, add protein, and zenu

562
01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.840
Stevia Protein Coffee Mix

563
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:08.400
This is a financial box office hit of 20 million, over 10 million

564
01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:11.280
KB Star Banking

565
01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:16.440
Until it becomes a financial box office hit for everyone in Korea

566
01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:32.040
It's not that bad because I'm heartbroken. I'm a little bloated. The pharmacy is not that bad, no, let's not endure the heartburn and bloating enough to eat gelphosel at once, but let's just start.

567
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.080
Tangerine posel

568
01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:43.180
retirement pension Hana Bank IP Hana Bank all together

569
01:13:47.640 --> 01:14:02.000
Oh, you're Green Bia, too. You have to take care of your breakfast. That's right. Nutrition balance is important, and you need to pay attention to your sugar level. I'm so delicious. downstream nutritional supplements

570
01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.020
Green via

571
01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:17.920
Everyone, let's go together. It's easy to get together better with Sol's meeting account, so the meeting fee is better, so come to Sinan to get together better

572
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:30.380
GS Caltex brought the first set and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction brought the second set. The second set was a close game of deuce. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co., Ltd

573
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:35.260
In the end, the set score was frozen 1 to 1 when the set was brought after a close race between professors.

574
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:41.460
GS Caltex also has a lot of mistakes in the second half. There were 4 mistakes in the first set. There are 12 mistakes

575
01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:45.760
And Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's player Lee Hae-joon still scored four points

576
01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.760
Since we have 3 blocks, we can only do one attack

577
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.260
You're doing it. We need to solve this part more

578
01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:54.560
When it comes to HYOJIN, no matter how hard it is

579
01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:59.660
When it's over, I'm doing it to a certain extent. That's right. You need to think about that

580
01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:04.520
Moma created the set that was all tilted like a miracle. That's right.

581
01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:08.680
The score distribution of both teams is pretty similar today

582
01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:19.920
Moma is at the center, Jeong Joon, Ko Hye-rim, and GS Caltex are at the center, followed by Kwon Min-jae and Ryu So-yeon. When the sponsorship system was over, I told you that GS Caltex should play games like this often

583
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:32.260
The reason is not that it's a game that gives out a set, but you have to keep playing in this urgency deuce situation. Young players' hearts get sticky and then they enjoy it.

584
01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:35.320
And you have to overcome it to become a strong team. That's right.

585
01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:47.240
We exchanged 1 set each, but after this set, how will the early flow of this 3 set be? Usually, after a set like this

586
01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:56.560
What didn't work out on the team taking it, starts to unravel, and I expect Hyundai to score a little more points in the middle broker today.

587
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.140
3 sets off with Yoshiyeon's serve

588
01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.940
It's out.

589
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:13.680
GS Caltex made eight mistakes at the end of the set after no mistakes in the second set, but it was overturned after leading 20 to 16. That's what I'm saying. Yes.

590
01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.580
Oh Hyerim,

591
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.520
It's Sujin and Oh Sehyun

592
01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.500
It's still Bum-pil. There are two mistakes.

593
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:36.000
This is how Oh Se-hyun was in the second seat and became a beat. Yes. Then it's hard to position the sub receiving if the first ball isn't quite as accurate. You have to go this way.

594
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.280
If the reception is shaken, the opportunity comes again. Rome

595
01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.640
Cho Hee Hoon is on the other side

596
01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:43.980
You didn't stop him.

597
01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:44.940
It's Luckout.

598
01:16:48.900 --> 01:17:00.820
Today, Jung Ji-hoon is consistently showing a high attack success rate. Silva's right hand hit him and he's out. It's three to zero.

599
01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.240
Kim Hyun-kyeon's scaffolding

600
01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.200
Jeong Jiyoon

601
01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:09.800
Out. Yes.

602
01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:19.140
The course was good for now. But the ball got longer because I got hit on the cheek before the elbow spread. I think I'm looking at whether it's in or out.

603
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:28.640
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction team requested to read the bidders for the in-out.

604
01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.180
Yes, yes, yes. 3:0

605
01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:39.500
The reading confirmed that it was out. Yes, it's confirmed to be out.

606
01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.020
3

607
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.620
Out of the first four points, three points are coming out for both teams.

608
01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.260
It's hard. HYOJIN

609
01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.980
Silva managed to save it and Kwon Minji. Yes

610
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:20.440
GS Caltex is a mistake again. That's right. Ko Min-ji tried to touch out, but Yang Hyo-jin seems to know in advance and put his hand down. Yes, I want to tell you. Yes

611
01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.140
The situation is over. I gave you one ball.

612
01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.540
Scilla scored 15 points

613
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:42.880
The result is different from the difference in the distance. You need to run a little faster in advance.

614
01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:47.460
4

615
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:54.500
Silva

616
01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.440
I manage to turn my serve over to the plot.

617
01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:03.040
Hit the mat to Kwon Min-ji on the other side of Han Soo-jin.

618
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:10.680
KWON MIJIN was too greedy and he was much bigger than his own

619
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:24.020
It's out of control. Four out of five Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction points are GS Caltex's mistakes. You need to make it a little lighter. In a way, it's like reviving the atmosphere of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.

620
01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:31.540
However, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction also has more mistakes than usual today. The score is 5 to 3

621
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:49.580
Kwon Min-ji received 10 points and a 53% fertilizer success rate today, and this is the score.

622
01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:54.640
GS Caltex, which has lost concentration in the game

623
01:19:54.740 --> 01:20:02.360
Kim Hyung-geun's reception was long now. I have to deal with it from above, but I missed this.

624
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.560
6

625
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.040
Yoo Se-hyeon

626
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.940
Throw yourself to the defense. Go Yerim

627
01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:15.200
It's out.

628
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:24.600
There are too many mistakes of both teams in the third set. It's out as it is.

629
01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:30.140
6

630
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:37.740
January

631
01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.680
It's too much of a mind.

632
01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.480
Both teams have too many sailboats in the third set.

633
01:20:45.820 --> 01:21:00.440
7

634
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.640
It's not perfect.

635
01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.180
I can't see it even now.

636
01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.640
Keep it alive and push it away.

637
01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:25.720
Both teams are in such a chaotic mood right now. It's chaotic. It needs to be sorted out quickly, and there are many reasons why it's confusing, but we have to do it more tightly when we're not able to focus on the game, but this gesture comes out because of this wild evil spirit.

638
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:33.760
What's wrong with silver? I think my knees are not good again. Take out the Silva. Lee Ju-hwa has entered. Silver is taking off his shoes right now.

639
01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:52.660
Oh Kyung-won's Yang Hyo-jin Yang Hyo-jin's score finally comes out. That's right. It's too late to score, but you have to run around and improve your condition a little more. It's still too close to the ball. This is the first technical timeout of three sets.

640
01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.040
This is Suwon.

641
01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:10.460
Is my sugar the only one missing? I don't think so? We added protein. Zero sugar, zero cholesterol, zero sugar, plus protein, my stevia protein coffee mix

642
01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:35.260
Are our kids doing well? I want to go home Where is it? I'll be rooting for you. all over the world

643
01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:41.080
Rispel Job Korea Albamon, an adult or everything in the world,

644
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:59.380
After Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction and GS Caltex exchanged one set each, they have been spending the beginning of the third set a little cluttered. Silva seems to have a bad right ankle, so he's coming out now.

645
01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.720
Backtos Lee Jooah, successful.

646
01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:13.760
I think Lee Jae-hwa will be able to see a lot next year. Of course. Yes, I'm getting it now

647
01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:19.260
I'm adapting quickly to the Touroo. 8 to 2 points

648
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:28.520
I ran in and threw my body to defend.

649
01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.840
It's a ball that hits.

650
01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.200
Kim Hyun-kyu quickly connects to BEOMA Blue Key

651
01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:42.060
Oh Se-hyun's blocking score. Oh Se-hyun is quite tall. All right.

652
01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:53.320
Oh Se-hyun, who is ranked third in blocking, and Oh Ah-man, where did you take it out after you got caught like this?

653
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.700
Kim Hyun-kyung is connecting to the 2nd stage, but she's a little lost

654
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.300
Left hand

655
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.480
Let's move on.

656
01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:10.100
It's coming back.

657
01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:13.220
Yang Hyo-jin

658
01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.980
Kwon Minji sold,

659
01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:26.800
Lee Ju-ah, makes a score for a Luckout. Lee Joo-ah, who is now in the apogit position, attacks much more comfortably. That's right

660
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:40.640
The reason why it is not being sorted out quickly is that we are playing with different goals now, but I think we have to play well. Yes. It's tied at 8 to 8.

661
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:45.900
The cutting board could not be saved in a row.

662
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:56.200
9

663
01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:58.640
I'm requesting an operational time. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co., Ltd

664
01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:14.240
Why is the taba so chaotic? It's suddenly chaotic. It's good to bring it back, and if it doesn't work or two, it's going to get messy like this. The connection and the connection parts are not working. You have to connect it when both sides don't have issues. It's not working well

665
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:29.200
No, not the front. He didn't know from the back, but I think he'll give it from the back. They say you can't keep Libero because it's over there. Let's go back to sleep. Calmly

666
01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:46.100
Most of the players have experienced it, but yes, if you go to spring volleyball now, there will be much stronger pressure than now. Coach Kang Seo-young hopes to get out of these moments a little wisely in preparation for then.

667
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:50.860
GS Caltex succeeded in turning the tables with four consecutive points.

668
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.080
Hit him in the middle.

669
01:25:58.140 --> 01:26:00.760
Oh, it's out.

670
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:18.000
It's moving forward with a back a like this. Yeah, but the reason why I'm doing this is that I think the willingness to shake up the opponent's Brookings is not moving at all.

671
01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.500
Self-receiving is shaking.

672
01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.860
Highball Spike

673
01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:26.100
I lifted it lightly. Backtust migration

674
01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:28.440
The players overlapped.

675
01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.560
Ryu So-yeon defended behind the Whale Mail Open

676
01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.140
Kwak Min-ji

677
01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:36.320
I hit my head and came up.

678
01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:42.940
Soojin who made the connection exactly to the inside of the body once again

679
01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.280
Challenge

680
01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.880
This is a success.

681
01:26:50.740 --> 01:27:02.000
Rather, GS Caltex's players' concentration is much better, and from the standpoint of blocking and defense, their teamwork is much better.

682
01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.660
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has six players playing separately right now.

683
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.400
Is it your fault? Yes, I stopped by.

684
01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:25.880
GS Caltex has scored seven points in a row, but there's no Silva on the court right now. Yes

685
01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:30.880
Hwang Hyun-joo goes in instead of body eggs.

686
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:48.180
I think we need GSK. Yes, yes, that's right. There needs to be a change. GS Caltex is playing so well today that I wonder when it scored seven consecutive points against Hyundai. 12 to 8

687
01:27:52.640 --> 01:28:00.220
As soon as you come in, you make a score. I think you need to go in and organize the court. Yes.

688
01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.960
Well

689
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:12.080
If you run for 21 years, can you see what I should do? Yes. Yes, yes. It's organized. Yes. It's shaken by the lease.

690
01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:26.800
Open. Lee Ju Hwan is... Yes, yes. He's doing a great job. It's not even on the left, but I think I just hit the roof on the right side, but I'm scoring anyway. All right.

691
01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:36.640
Then shouldn't modern players be able to defend at least this much? It's 13 to 9.

692
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.560
Open

693
01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.360
Han Min-chi (Korean wordplay)

694
01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.040
It's on.

695
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.360
I'm going to turn it over for now.

696
01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.620
Dear Lee Ju,

697
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.380
Kim Jiwon and Kwon Minji

698
01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:12.660
Silva is very comfortable clapping from Wonwoo's table. That's right. Yes. Director Kang Seo-young will take out Yang Hyo-jin as well. I put Na Yeon-soo on the spot.

699
01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:13.520
Ah.

700
01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:24.480
I hit Kim Hyunkyung underneath

701
01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:44.820
Jung Ji-hoon scored 12 points today. Thank you for the bean cut. There needs to be an older sister who can say bitter things in the courtroom. Yes. You need to be able to concentrate on the game.

702
01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:48.860
Thank you for your sharp serve and you have to hit me. You have to hit the back

703
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:57.960
Yes, I'm clearly shaking off the disappointment of the previous two sets with the third set attack. That's right.

704
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:04.580
No. 7 makes a score by saying, "Take a break even for a moment."

705
01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:07.260
Shall we see the serve?

706
01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:14.620
Jeong Ji-hyun

707
01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:17.020
A single pig. Yes

708
01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.280
Lee Ju Hwan, stop it.

709
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:29.080
Without Kim Hyun-joo's procedure. Yes, we almost had a fun scene.

710
01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:30.640
I'm really flabbergasted. Yes.

711
01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:40.840
They attack me on a good course and stop me

712
01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.700
Hwang Hyun-joo scored. by 15 to 1

713
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.220
While falling, Harry

714
01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:58.040
Open Kwon Min-jae's score made it 16 to 11. I'm in the second technical timeout of the third set. This is Suwon.

715
01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:13.520
Are our kids doing well today as well? I just got to work now, but I'm already hungry. I want to see my mom. I want to go home. Do you have a white card?

716
01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:17.840
Come on in. It's okay

717
01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:30.520
Everyone is doing well. Tomorrow is growing well, so everything you work for, everything in the world, respect job Korea, Albamon

718
01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:44.160
It's not that bad because I'm heartbroken. I'm a little bloated. The pharmacy is not that bad. No, it's not that bad. Don't endure the pain and bloating that you're eating gel force at once

719
01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.860
Let's start. Tangerine posel

720
01:31:48.980 --> 01:32:02.340
GS Caltex is currently leading by 5 points at the age of 3 with many consecutive points. Both teams are missing foreign players from Moma and Silva. Yes. Korean players are playing on the court now.

721
01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:12.860
That's right. Two weeks, two weeks. But on days like this, once you hit it, you have a very high chance of scoring a point. You have to give me a lot. Yes

722
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:20.380
Lee Ju, who has a 50% attack success rate of 6 points today. With Kwon Min-ji coming out, Yu Gwan-nam was put in.

723
01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:39.280
Jung Soo-hyun's thread was a little short. It's an open spike defense.

724
01:32:47.160 --> 01:33:00.620
Jung Joon is making a score with his strength, and Kim Da-in is still in the process of tossing, so his hand has to come in and he has to get out, but the tip of his hand hits him and he just goes out, so this ball is shaking because he has no power. Yes.

725
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.540
Let's get to our seats quickly and cheerfully

726
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:19.740
Lee Ju-hwa and Lee Ju-hwan are doing a one-man show today, regardless of the result of the game until the central hole attack. All of a sudden, Lee Joo-hwa is like that. It popped out when I was three years old.

727
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:27.540
Why are you out there hitting me so well.

728
01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:33.400
It becomes Park Hyun-joo's back attack bound.

729
01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:36.880
To Lee So-yeon

730
01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:39.000
I'm good at defending.

731
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.780
Let's move on.

732
01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.900
Oh Se-hyun is floating. That's right

733
01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:57.840
Yes, 18 to 1. Yes, yes, yes. Overall, GS Caltex players are playing better defense and playing well, especially in the connection part.

734
01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.240
Director Kang Seo-young can't hide his frustration. It's time out.

735
01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:13.180
And the center is the center, but I'll finish this quickly

736
01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:27.300
It goes out a little faster, and we have to get it down faster over there, too. We're fast, too

737
01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:35.720
This is director Han Se-young, who talked to the setter first.

738
01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:50.640
That's how important Kim Da-in is. If you look at the contents of today's game, the contents of the game are so different that you don't know who went without Bonn. Hyundai E&amp;C players are very late in their second movement. You can move in advance

739
01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.720
Kim Young-hyun, Lee Dae-hyun,

740
01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:08.860
Lee Da-yeon's attack score came out after a long time. I think I only saw one fastball when I was playing a father-in-law a while ago. So I thought it was over without watching it

741
01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:23.900
I think Lee Da-hyun's fast attack is also his first attack today. It's a mistake, getting caught in the 18 vs 13 net.

742
01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:26.400
19 to 13

743
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:38.180
Kim Ji-won

744
01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:54.500
From this side, it leads to the blocking of Yoshi-hyun. The ball came just as Yoo Seon was waiting. Yes. It's happening until 20-13. Yes.

745
01:35:54.580 --> 01:36:02.440
Kim Jiwon tries again with a 7-point gap

746
01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.040
Let's put it here

747
01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.060
Let's have a chance. Go Hyerim

748
01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.720
It's 20 to 14.

749
01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:29.080
Of course, Yang Hyo-jin and Moma are out now, but the game hasn't gone well, but there will be times when Hwang Hye-jin and Na Hyun-soo, who are in now, will definitely need them when they make a fake. Of course. Yes.

750
01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.680
Hoyoung Lee Direct Key

751
01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:47.780
You can't just play volleyball with six or seven people. So it's not about playing time, it's about at what point I'll score and at what point I'll create an atmosphere for the players and play this role. It's a time-out juice caltex.

752
01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:56.040
Let's get back to where we're going

753
01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.860
It's more laid down. This is the wrong direction

754
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:22.960
For GS Caltex, from the 1st to the 3rd set, it will shake little by little if you keep going in the second half of the set. Yes, in that regard, director Lee Hyung-taek is pointing it out a little and also emphasized the receiving part.

755
01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:34.300
20 to 155 points. Oh Se-yoon needs to move quickly because there's almost no rear-end attack

756
01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:35.880
The reception is shaky.

757
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.740
I couldn't.

758
01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:46.400
It's Lee Joo-ah on the opposite side of Kim Ji-won's dig. Spike

759
01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.460
Let's keep Hyunjoo alive. Goo Hyeri

760
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.280
It falls on the inside.

761
01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.500
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co., Ltd. is catching up again with 20 to 16

762
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:11.240
This course has no defense. If you can hit me, this course has a really high success rate. That's how much RBI and speed need to come out. Lee Ju-hwa came out and Silva was put back in.

763
01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:19.940
General. Yes, come inMake a score as soon as you go to bed.

764
01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.440
21

765
01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:30.660
Jamsil Bar player, too

766
01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.280
I didn't feel good around my ankle, so I went out and prepared to keep running. Yes

767
01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:46.340
Wei came in. Cosy, I like it. Yes

768
01:38:46.880 --> 01:39:01.620
But fortunately, Jung Yoon-ji, Jung Ji-hoon, and Ko Ye-rim are not in bad shape today. Both players have double-digit scores in today's game. It has an investment success rate of more than 40%.

769
01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:09.040
I need to look at it again

770
01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.200
It's soaring up and coming over.

771
01:39:12.260 --> 01:39:13.140
Here we go again.

772
01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:19.140
It's your score. There's no room for the second one. Yes

773
01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:34.060
It's Silva who is lightly making scores. And overall, Kim Ji-hyun's back-to-back today has a very good RBI pitcher. Yes, it's 22 to 17. a five-point gap

774
01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:43.900
It's going to be hard

775
01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:46.680
Put it on top

776
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.220
I'm going to Silva.

777
01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:51.900
back-to-back hits

778
01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:55.240
I'm in position. One more time, Silva

779
01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.920
Hwang Hyun-joo's master lifts Go Hari.

780
01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.760
Is it working out? Poica

781
01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:06.580
Nice attack Jung Ji-yoon This is a really pleasant score.

782
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:12.420
There will be offensive points that can save the atmosphere of the four teams at once.

783
01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:21.900
If he couldn't stay, the ball would have had no choice but to hit the RBI quickly, but a very bold attack came out. Yes, 22 to 28

784
01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.360
two-hand push

785
01:40:35.460 --> 01:40:37.600
Points are declared.

786
01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:43.500
However, we ask you to read the video as to whether it is a point or not.

787
01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:55.980
GS Caltex team requested a video review for 4 hits.

788
01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:10.800
That's right. In this case, if you hit it, it was confirmed as a pitch by the director's power. The opponent's bros are pushed by that power

789
01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:25.180
There's a high probability that I'll get it right. Now I'm pulling it with two hands. Yes, coaches of both teams of today's game rarely reverse this video review right now. The judges' decision is correct today.

790
01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:33.540
23

791
01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.460
Moman is still in the king's zone.

792
01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:52.020
That Moma player is Silva's and needs to be stimulated a little bit. Silva scored 31 points more consistently in the entire game. Awesome. Yes

793
01:41:53.620 --> 01:41:56.380
I came to the eye drops again.

794
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:22.140
Hwang Hyun-joon lowers his attack success rate of 60% of his three points today.

795
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.600
TAG OUT WITHOUT THE CENTER.

796
01:42:25.740 --> 01:42:36.660
Now, the gap, which was widened to a 7-point gap, narrows to a 2-point gap. That's right. GS Caltex players need to overcome this crisis a little bit. Time Out GS Caltex

797
01:42:42.860 --> 01:42:53.960
Don't be in a hurry. Don't be flustered. Just be comfortable and don't be in a hurry

798
01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:18.000
Once again, the juice that is getting anxious late in the set is Keith. Usually, there are two types of receiving players. One is the type who doesn't want to come to me at times like this and the type who wants to hit me at times like this

799
01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:26.760
Yes. The second type would be good. I'm the first one. Is that so? It's 23 to 212 points.

800
01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.620
The 25th is shaking.

801
01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.480
I saved Kwon Minji's opening

802
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.840
Salvation is behind YUN SEO HYUN without attacking Silva

803
01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:56.960
All right. Kim Jihyun is pointing out the details of the game. Yes, we will welcome the set points of the 24:21 GS Caltex 3 set.

804
01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.080
Kwon Minji

805
01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:09.580
I really enjoyed watching it.

806
01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:26.040
Such a sub is the first danger. You put it in so safely. Yes, I feel sorry for no reason. Yes, director Lee Young-taek is also now. I couldn't hide my considerable regret.

807
01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:39.900
It's director Kang Se-young who puts in the concerns. That's right. And it's because Ko Min-ji also has to play well in the remaining games. I've been giving a lot of numbers since my injury.

808
01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.800
The reception went well.

809
01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.960
It became silver. Fair enough.

810
01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.280
I saved it.

811
01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:57.440
In the end, 25 to 22 GS Caltex will take three sets.

812
01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:09.400
With a set score of 2 to 1, GS Caltex is now leading again. We'll be broadcasting in four numbers in a little while. This is the Suwon gym.

813
01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:25.260
waking up to the alarm every day, leaving the house every morning, waiting for acceptance, agonizing all night, and facing the end

814
01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:29.800
And what you're starting over

815
01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:45.160
I hope good things happen to everyone who works. Everything in the world, respect job Korea's Albamon Eo is also Greenvia. You have to take care of your breakfast. That's right.

816
01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:56.220
Nutrition balance is important. And you have to pay attention to your sugar, so you feel reassured. It's so delicious for me. Downstream Nutrition Green Via

817
01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:18.460
Change the next schedule to 12 o'clock tomorrow and text Jin.

818
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:38.900
I'm sorry. It's not that bad. I'm a little bloated. It's not that big. No, it's not that big. Don't endure the heartburn and bloating that you can eat with Galpos at once

819
01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:53.160
Let's get started. Tangerine Posel. Do you know why Dodram Han Don is the No. 1 player? Experts keep the freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. No. 1 Meister to make Dodram dons

820
01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:55.700
Let's try the taste that you like

821
01:46:57.420 --> 01:47:05.980
Retirement pension Hana Bank i Hana Bank all together

822
01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:19.800
As GS Caltex took three sets, it is now leading with a set score of 2 to 1.

823
01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:30.780
In the third set, both teams made a lot of mistakes, and in the case of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, both Moma and Yang Hyun-jin went out a little bit as the attack did not go away.

824
01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:45.580
That's right. And JS Caltex has a very good pattern in attack today and is making attack success rate. Of course, Silva is leading, but Kwon Min-ji and Ryu So-yeon are on the left

825
01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:53.540
He's scoring a lot. In particular, in the third set, while Silva was briefly injured, Lee Joo-ah scored 63% and scored 6 points

826
01:47:53.620 --> 01:48:08.160
He scored the most points in the set. That's right. Since he has shown that he can do it regardless of his right side, Lee Jae-hwan will have more opportunities to appear on the court whenever he has a chance. First of all, director Kang Sung-young excluded Yang Hyo-jin and his mother village.

827
01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:09.940
I have precipitation. Yes

828
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:13.480
The two key players of the team are missing

829
01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:17.640
Hwang Hyun-joo and Na Hyun-soo will take over.

830
01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.480
Hi.

831
01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:32.440
If you go to the checkout counter, I'm going to run full-time today to improve the condition of the players and even if I take a break from the next game, I'm going to make the opportunity to use this strength

832
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.640
It's a part, and two of the key players came out of the court. That's right.

833
01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:44.940
Now, we're preparing for the 4th set.

834
01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:53.320
Kim Da-in scored his 2nd serve today

835
01:48:54.380 --> 01:49:04.200
These days, all seven teams are good at this short serve. Yes

836
01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:08.640
KWON MIN JI will take it

837
01:49:09.160 --> 01:49:11.220
Park Se-na was out of sync.

838
01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:15.220
I'm Jung Ji-yoon of the attack against Shin Kwang-ho.

839
01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:21.420
Jung Ji-hoon is the player who is showing the most consistent attack at Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction today.

840
01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:34.760
That's right. Since Oma is out, Jung Ji-yoon continues to try the pipe in the middle during the second attack. Also, in spring volleyball, we don't know what will happen in the playoffs, so such an attempt is good.

841
01:49:37.300 --> 01:49:41.120
Ford Ball among the connected Kim Hyun-gyeon

842
01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:54.140
He hit me. This is the problem. Look at the problem that you need to think about right now. Does Kim Hyun-kyun have to run like that and post it? Should Lee Da-yeon put it up comfortably?

843
01:49:54.220 --> 01:50:01.620
If you run now, you can't connect it straight. Of course, Kim Hyun-gil is chasing behind the advance fund.

844
01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:06.760
It was a little short.

845
01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:09.820
Oh Hyerim succeeded. All right.

846
01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:12.940
The score is 3 to 1.

847
01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:21.260
Ko Hye-rim and Jung Ju-hyun were good today, so if Yang Hyo-jin and Moma were in good condition

848
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:29.400
Coach Kang Sung-hyun could have made a game that he was really looking forward to. Yes. The receiving is shaking.

849
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:36.460
Jeong Ji-hoon scored a block out by turning Silva's consecutive hits into defense

850
01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:52.080
The score is 4 to 1. Yes. A good attack came out that changed the atmosphere. Yes. Jung Ji-yoon is responsible for this because the oldest player, Yeon-hyun and Hwang In-soo, are connected. It's four to one. I'm ahead by three points.

851
01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:02.480
Strong. Silva is scoring the 20th point.

852
01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:17.800
But you still have to cheer up a little bit to get to your average score per game. The market share itself is high today by Kwon Min-ji and Yoo Sun on the left. Yes. He is averaging over 31 points per game.

853
01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:37.800
Silva, who makes an ace with one point, has a song sub like a real cannon. Yes. If you're this strong with speed

854
01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:45.520
The exact serve went in as if the male player was really right. A row of intuitionists. Yes.

855
01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:48.020
4

856
01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.520
Shake the receiving with a strong serve again.

857
01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:56.240
Cold water juice. Patex Silva overhand

858
01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:59.080
Cast steel stone sword successful.

859
01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:12.260
He scored 6 points again. Yes. Now the attack success rate is 83%. That's right. I wasn't ready to attack where Lee Da-hyun was looking before that. Yes.

860
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:26.760
I'm requesting an operational time. Coach Kang Seo-young, I'm going to prepare and hit him in any situation, there's only a car in front of him. Even if you can't make a decision to make something like that, there's something called a structure. That's what it is

861
01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:33.220
So, Dayeon can't catch anything that's not caught either. But when it's in this hand, I hold it one by one. I'm just saying that you'll come when it tastes like your hands

862
01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:40.760
In any situation, you have to hit the ball when it comes.

863
01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:51.580
And it was too far from Hwang Hyun-jae's posting. Instead of thinking that it's going to go to Jung Ji Hoon, you have to get ready to hit him and take care of him in the count

864
01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:57.660
Rather than making a cool score, there should be no mistakes in small things. Yes.

865
01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.600
They tied the game four times with three consecutive points.

866
01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:07.500
a short serve

867
01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:11.600
I put it up. It gives me power.

868
01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:18.740
Jung Jihoon got blocked right away. Where are you going? Please come after Jung Ji-hoon again.

869
01:53:21.240 --> 01:53:22.960
5

870
01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:30.260
I did a good job with this. First, rebound play. Then, when you get a chance, you have to be strong

871
01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:40.940
It was 5 to 4 by making a touch and a score. Ryu So-yeon's receiving

872
01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:43.120
It's a bloody success.

873
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:47.260
KWON MIN JI scored 14 points

874
01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:59.840
5

875
01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:05.960
Kwon Bin-ji will serve the 2nd ball.

876
01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:13.500
Go Hyerim, left stop

877
01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:15.660
Han Soojin's dig jumper

878
01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:16.820
one's last chance

879
01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:21.220
I saw the defense. Hwang Hyun-joo lifted it. The 2nd level connection is too weak

880
01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:23.880
It's out.

881
01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:37.880
Yes, GS Caltex leads with a score of 6 to 5.

882
01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:43.960
Due to a mistake, GS Caltex is now leading by one point.

883
01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:52.320
Park Hyunjoo as Backers

884
01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:54.280
I'm blocked.

885
01:54:54.520 --> 01:55:08.660
Blocking point Louis moved in advance and a good block came out. Yes, if Na Hyun-soo was a non-kick, it should be this short, but he was a kick. Yes

886
01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:14.520
Now, the provincial government is ahead of itself.

887
01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:23.140
Kim Hyun-kyung came out and watched it. Kim Hyunjoo is here.

888
01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.920
The score is 7 to 61 points

889
01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:37.560
There's a one-point gap, and coach Kang Se-young

890
01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:47.560
Except for Hwang Hyun-joo and Kim Da-in, Moma and Kim Sa-rang are put in, first of all, increasing the number of avant-garde attacks.

891
01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:57.860
I think he thought he needed to give Mom a little more time to improve his condition. Yes

892
01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:03.400
The serve was long.

893
01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:09.240
He's getting his first dead-knick timeout of four sets as he goes 8-6. This is Suwon.

894
01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:15.660
Compass of Korea's Health

895
01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.960
Korea's First Stomach Health Double Formulation Will Peony

896
01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.980
I'm going to take care of my stomach's health

897
01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:27.300
As expected, it's an outpatient on the top.

898
01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:36.820
Coming soon to Travelcard for all travel masters in the world. Travelogue and Visa met.

899
01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:41.180
Just Go Hana Visa Travel Gow

900
01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:56.720
Oh, you're Green Bia, too. You have to take care of your breakfast. That's right. Nutrition is also important. And you have to pay attention to your family, too. I feel reassured. I'm so delicious. Healthcare Downstream Nutrition, Jeong Food

901
01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:57.560
Green via

902
01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:06.420
GS Caltex leads by 2 points, 8 to 0.

903
01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:11.240
For Hyundai E&amp;C, Moma player is back in.

904
01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:24.600
He's getting ready to serve. Yes. It shows an attack success rate of 83% with 7 points blocked.

905
01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:31.580
Dewey isn't particularly outstanding, but he's defending that position too well. It might be because of that.

906
01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:39.100
I can't see any gaps. Ddoi and Oh Se-hyun are now in charge of the mid-blocker, so they've stabilized a bit. Yes, yes.

907
01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:49.880
First, Moma came in and scored the first attack.

908
01:57:51.720 --> 01:58:02.820
The score is 8 to 7. There's a reason why Kim Sa-rang goes in. If you put it in with Moma, it is right to give a little more each time you have a chance.

909
01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:04.720
The reception was short.

910
01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:07.800
I saved it

911
01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:10.640
Please give it to me again.

912
01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.720
Ko Hyerim's Dig

913
01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:14.700
I get up and hit him.

914
01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:22.820
It's Silva after keeping it alive. Jung Ji-hoon defended and once again, Go Hye-rim Pike,

915
01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:26.200
Han Soo-jin, Yoseoyeon's real number

916
01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.880
That's a score. Yes, yes.

917
01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:33.520
Touch out

918
01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:40.100
This score GS Caltex has a goal to gain strength again.

919
01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:50.880
I guess it really passed by a little bit.

920
01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:54.720
Unit 7

921
01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:58.640
KWON MIN JI who saves Kang Seok Gong

922
01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:14.100
There are two players, Ko Ye-rim and Na Yeon-soo, so Silva was attacking with confidence and Kwon Min-ji is doing well behind the scenes today. Yes.

923
01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:18.700
The score is 10 to 7

924
01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:27.320
It ran and Soo-jin once again receives Ko Hye-rim's attack. Let's jump

925
01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:32.620
11 vs. 7 for quick handling.

926
01:59:33.860 --> 01:59:40.920
Lee Soo-yeon is so good at looking at the straight line and hitting it. This is Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction requesting operation time.

927
01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:58.620
Hey, why did you two change so much? Yes, you said you have to go somewhere you can go. That means you have to go to the night even if Lee Seo-hyun is not there. That's how you go probabilistically. If everyone comes this way because you're having a hard time, it's meaningless.

928
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:15.700
There is no meaningless replacement. As I said, there's a reason why I'm going in. I've decided on my mom and dad

929
02:00:15.780 --> 02:00:24.060
If you hit the ball more and there's Yoo Sun-young in the back, you have to go more, but if Kim Sun-hwan goes to the side where his face is comfortable

930
02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:25.540
I'm doing it.

931
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:29.560
GS Caltex, which has scored three points in a row, leads 11-7.

932
02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:37.880
I got trained and it's a mock award

933
02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:39.400
block-out score

934
02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.660
11

935
02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:54.240
Maga sees the blocker and hits it to make it the 15th point.

936
02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:06.480
Na Hyunsoo's serve score. Na Hyunsoo

937
02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:13.400
11

938
02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:20.840
It dropped with little rotation.

939
02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:30.680
12

940
02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:37.940
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction serves better, and there are more breaking, but it's the only part of offense

941
02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:48.300
GS Caltex is leading the way, especially in the post-dig counterattack process. It's 12 to 9.

942
02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:58.280
I'm going to turn it over for now. I'll make it long

943
02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.420
Moa boasts a wide view.

944
02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:18.680
Han Soo-jin also defended well, but Silva also passed his inevitable body, but he doesn't miss it. The gap narrows a little by two points.

945
02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:23.020
Moma who has a serve score today

946
02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:28.380
It's out.

947
02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:43.120
It's out of the way. It's 12 to 11-1 points. Kwon Min-ji should have a different batting style when there is a mother player in front of him and Kim Sun-hwan. I'm requesting an operational time. GS Caltex

948
02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:13.360
You have to concentrate until the end. Don't kill us. Let's keep doing the best

949
02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:18.920
Coach Lee Young-taek also felt a little sorry for the mistake in the counterattack situation after the defense

950
02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:30.000
I told him to keep his concentration until the end. It's a one-point difference. It's 12 to 11. Moma's serve will continue.

951
02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:36.520
It's out.

952
02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:38.920
All right.

953
02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:41.420
Thirteen to 11 for a serve mistake

954
02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:48.380
The course was very good. It's a bit off. Yes

955
02:03:50.660 --> 02:03:53.600
Oh Sehyun with 5 points today

956
02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:00.120
I fell down. Direct key

957
02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:06.360
Yes, Ddoi and Kwon Min-ji slightly overlapped.

958
02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:18.040
Ddoi solved it. Yes, you have to be greedy with cheeks like this. Yes, it's a bonus. But it shouldn't be bumped. By all means.

959
02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:25.620
Take mine to the center

960
02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.960
It's soaring. Oh my

961
02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:31.340
It's out of live-by-dye.

962
02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:36.800
The previous two players bumped into each other, and now the two players have passed each other too much.

963
02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:42.520
I think we need some smooth agreement

964
02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:50.360
From now on, Kwon Min-ji has to do it.

965
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:52.320
The reception is shaky.

966
02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:55.820
Hit Kwon Minji Netin.

967
02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.080
14 to 131 points

968
02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:24.620
After Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's mistake of tying the game, Ko Hye-rim quickly took some after the mistake and served before getting ready. Director Lee Young-taek mentioned this part before. That's right.

969
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:26.760
one's last chance

970
02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.440
I'm out of sync.

971
02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:32.920
Kim Jaehyun's Lee Dong. Yes, it's a success.

972
02:05:33.160 --> 02:05:35.660
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction ahead of the game

973
02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:45.600
Now, Lee Da-hyun's moving attack, which was not seen, came out. 15 to 14 Kim Sa-rang center is also in the court right now

974
02:05:45.760 --> 02:05:49.860
I'm working well with the players right now.

975
02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:54.100
It's touch out.

976
02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:56.680
15

977
02:05:58.540 --> 02:06:10.160
So, even though this Silva was in an avant-garde position, he scored consecutive points. Yes, these things are a bit disappointing. It's tied again.

978
02:06:14.260 --> 02:06:16.960
Silva with serve points today

979
02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:29.040
This time, it's pushed out. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is facing its second technical timeout of four sets, with a 16-10 lead of one point. This is Suwon.

980
02:07:11.740 --> 02:07:14.140
I don't want to eat anything else

981
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:16.980
Why it's cheese? Pradak chicken

982
02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:30.180
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction took advantage of the wavering atmosphere of GS Caltex to create a reversal. He is leading by one point with 16 to 15.

983
02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:35.660
Moma and Kim Sa-rang, who entered the court, are also creating a good atmosphere.

984
02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:41.620
Lee Da-hyun of the sub

985
02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:45.680
It was fence-pain, but it was defended.

986
02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:49.160
It's coming back. Kim Ji-won.

987
02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:51.980
All right.

988
02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:53.800
All right.

989
02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:00.620
It's a decision that it's correct, but I'm asking for a video review.

990
02:08:06.860 --> 02:08:08.100
It's all our people

991
02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:26.300
I think I'll check if it fits the body of player Ko Hye-rim who defended. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction team requested a video review of the defender touchout. Your expression is a little strange. I'm not sure. Can you see it on the screen?

992
02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:44.540
Yes

993
02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:48.120
This defensive touch is actually a very difficult item to see.

994
02:08:54.740 --> 02:08:59.620
As a result of the reading, it was confirmed as no touch. It's confirmed that it's no touch.

995
02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:18.260
Yes, if this happens, the gap will be widened by one more point. First of all, if you can't check it on the screen, this judgment is coming out. 17 to 15

996
02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:24.100
Thank you.

997
02:09:25.680 --> 02:09:36.540
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction now leads by two points.

998
02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:41.940
It's a success.

999
02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:50.200
17

1000
02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:55.220
As I always say, he's a good striker. Yes, that’s right.

1001
02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:05.120
Player Woo Daram is here.

1002
02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:09.580
One, two, three

1003
02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:12.260
It's out.

1004
02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:16.660
18

1005
02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:21.040
I said I would do one every time I came in, but today I have two serve mistakes.

1006
02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:29.120
You have to cheer up. I'm Kim Sun-young.

1007
02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:35.380
The reception is shaky.

1008
02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:38.200
Lee Tae-yeon's consecutive batting rebound play

1009
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:45.820
Yes, it's a success for Tui. Technically, I used the fastball well. Yes, this is the 9th point of today's game

1010
02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:55.560
18

1011
02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:02.060
Jang Yu-jin is still outside.

1012
02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.480
a long annual leave in Rome

1013
02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:22.920
Moma is not your touch right now. I'm talking about all four touches of hair. Yes. It's quite sensitive. Yes. While enjoying Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction

1014
02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:30.040
Yes. I requested a video review of the touch. I introduced you.

1015
02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:47.540
Now, whether it's a shoulder or a head.

1016
02:11:52.700 --> 02:12:00.220
Let's see again.

1017
02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:10.840
I think this screen will be the best to see.

1018
02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:31.540
So even though my body was completely tilted in the net, if my head served as a cushion like this, it was confirmed as four touches as a result of my touch. I'm just looking at it. If it wasn't like that

1019
02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:39.280
It's a story that it's okay if it hits your hair even though your center was okay, but now I think your center is completely tilted.

1020
02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:41.740
It was tied at 18 to 18.

1021
02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:56.700
Let's pick a baektu. You're out. It's out.

1022
02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:05.560
The little one needs to find some composure. That's right. If you play in anger, it doesn't work out as you want. Yes.

1023
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:14.300
You have to be cool and show that you can do it enough. Itanes takes another step ahead.

1024
02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:20.760
a life-saving suicide note

1025
02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:26.080
It's inside. Yes.

1026
02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:36.320
GS Caltech's Song Hwa and Kim Ji-hoon, who scored four points in 20s and 18s in a row, are in perfect harmony today. Yes.

1027
02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:47.980
Rather than Silva's overstretched hitting ball, he uses enough speed when he comes in.

1028
02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:50.920
I'm out again.

1029
02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:56.400
The Roma player is a bit

1030
02:13:57.820 --> 02:14:00.360
I don't know. Yes.

1031
02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:09.780
I think I need to hurry up with my emotions. Yes, in this case, you need to distinguish whether the center should give it or not.

1032
02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:11.540
It's coming over.

1033
02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:13.700
GS Caltex Chance Ball

1034
02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:25.940
On the contrary, Silva is making a tremendous attack on this opportunity. GS Cal Defeat with six consecutive points from 22 to 18.

1035
02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:36.760
From Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's point of view, today's game is not meaningless. Of course. We need to calm down and prepare for the next game

1036
02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:43.820
25

1037
02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.040
Lee Seohyun, yes

1038
02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.600
It's a success.

1039
02:14:49.500 --> 02:15:01.660
Draw 7 points in a row. Starting 23 vs 18 and to this day, GS Caltex has much lower counterattacks since Dig. Yes Yes Yes

1040
02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:15.740
23 to 1.9 billion

1041
02:15:28.740 --> 02:15:29.740
Kim Ji-won

1042
02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:45.820
Match point of today's game GS Caltex, creating a touch-out score. In one way or another, Sinta makes all the points. Yes. Success rate close to 51%

1043
02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:52.980
It's already an average of 31 points.

1044
02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:03.840
24

1045
02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:14.760
It's still GS Caltex's match point today.

1046
02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:24.560
I got hit by defense

1047
02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:32.320
You have to make a score.

1048
02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:41.100
Rather than thinking that Kim Ji-won is one right now, it's manager Lee Young-taek who asks for operation time.

1049
02:16:41.460 --> 02:16:55.540
You have to get into it quickly. Do I have to be immersed in it? I have to prepare for the last one and deal with the places that come too fast. The wind also comes this way quickly, and the cold comes inside, too

1050
02:17:08.200 --> 02:17:20.080
It's GS Caltex with one match point left. In the last five rounds, Silva won by 3 to 2, scoring 35 points. Yes.

1051
02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:29.520
I put it up and you scored

1052
02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:38.580
25

1053
02:17:38.660 --> 02:17:43.060
That's right. Today's winner is the opponent who brought the existing members.

1054
02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:47.060
We showed great performance throughout the game and won today

1055
02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:54.260
This is the end of today's lecture broadcast. I was with artists Park Mi-hee. I was castor Lee Yong Hoon. Thank you, everyone. Bye
