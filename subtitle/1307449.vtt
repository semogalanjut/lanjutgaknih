00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:44.360
CH4 Red Sparks vs Pink Spiders

1
00:00:45.400 --> 00:01:00.360
Whether it ends in Daejeon or Incheon, the 4th game of the championship match between the two teams will begin now. In the last Game 3, the players of both teams really played a historic match.

2
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:10.000
Decent Dute 36-34 super-contest eventually succeeded in setting a new record for all-time Force season votes.

3
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:22.860
At that time, he did not win the deuce set, but Jeong Kwan-jang's players showed miraculous power thanks to the support of such hot home fans. Most of the main players are injured, so normally

4
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:34.700
It was difficult, but with miraculous power, he won a dramatic victory. Heungkuk Life Insurance players, who had only one win left until the championship, had to swallow their disappointment

5
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:47.940
In particular, it began to falter as the third promotion mistake increased, and today I tried to win the championship once again. Please watch with us from now on how the game of Game 4 between the two teams is going to be even hotter.

6
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.620
Then, connect the relay seat. Yes, announcer Kim Se-yeon opened the door to the game today.

7
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.720
Dodram 204,255 V-League articles of association, Leve Sparks, and Heungkuk Life's Pink Spiders

8
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:09.820
We'll be with you from now on for the 4th game of the V League Women's Championship. I'm castor Yoon Seong-ho. We will be with commentator Chanho and Chan Sanghyun. Hello Yes, hello? Yes

9
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.420
Oh, the one that unfolded just two days ago

10
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.320
Championship Game 3 between the two teams

11
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.320
During the broadcast, lawmaker Cha Sang-hyun said that. Superhuman strength, our mind, controls our bodies.

12
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.720
The game that made me talk about this

13
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.020
It was just the day before yesterday. That's right. It was the best game ever

14
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.820
The fans who watched this game on site said they were almost the winners

15
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.220
It was both teams that showed good performance. That's right.

16
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.220
So at one point, it was 36 to 34

17
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.020
When you look at the set of the V League championship game

18
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.520
There was also a new record for the most points.

19
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.320
First of all, what's in the corner today is Jeonggwanjang

20
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.020
Heungkuk Life still has some time to spare

21
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.320
Just like Han Shin from a country used to be for both teams

22
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:06.420
Wouldn't we be playing this game today with a great deal of camp? That's right. Yes, I want to wrap up today's game with Heungkuk Life

23
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.420
Since it's like this, it's probably Jeonggwanjang who wants to go all the way to Incheon.

24
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.020
That's why we can't finish this series at home today

25
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.420
On the other hand, from Heungkuk Life Insurance's perspective

26
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.820
I said that there's no Incheon

27
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.920
I actually started this series. That's right. First of all, both teams

28
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
Physically, it's definitely a situation where I can't help but feel pressure

29
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.220
It's natural for Director Jeong to take some more of that burden

30
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.620
Heungkuk Life Insurance's championship match starts on the 30th

31
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.920
Since today is the 6th, it's the best day in a week

32
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.520
It's been four games. Yes, physically, to some extent

33
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.320
It even came to a situation where we were confronted. Besides, except for the first game

34
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.820
Game 2, Game 3, Down 5 sets soon

35
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.420
I've played 10 sets in the last two games. That's right

36
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.720
If it's just a regular league, mental and other factors

37
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.820
It might not be as physically connected as now, but yes

38
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.620
The pressure to win only 100% now will definitely work.

39
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.820
It's a difficult situation in many ways. That's right.

40
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.920
You can check the results of the 3rd match of the championship game from the set score

41
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.420
It was more than that. Oh, that's right It's a set... Win or lose... It's a good thing

42
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.720
I'm sure there are things like winning rate

43
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.720
Other parts also clearly played a role. That's right. National center who missed the second round of the last playoff game with a right knee injury

44
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.920
Yeom Hye-sun showed her dream in the game on the day before yesterday

45
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.820
We decided to play the game until the end. All the time

46
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.520
The final score of the 2nd set duel is 36 to 34

47
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.420
The set score will continue in Director Jung. Heungkuk Life Insurance

48
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:03.320
It was a set that changed from Heungkuk Life to Jeonggwanjeong. That's right. While we were doing the broadcast, we focused on each and every ball

49
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.920
But there were situations where we couldn't do it, and Heungkuk Life took the 2nd set That's right. In the end, the last champion's decision

50
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.720
Just like in the second round

51
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:24.820
After Heungkuk Life won the second set, another reverse swing as it completely recovered the 345 sets of Jeonggwanjang, which showed an unbelievable game

52
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.320
It created a game. Right, we'll continue to

53
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.020
I can't help but say it's the best game ever

54
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.820
Heungkuk Life won the 12th game and won the 12th set, so just one set

55
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.620
If I won the set, I could've lifted the trophy

56
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.820
I'm not good enough for that one set

57
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.220
Eventually, we came to the fourth round. That's right.

58
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.220
As expected, Megawati Putlin's boyfriend is here today

59
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.520
I get to support my girlfriend. Coincidentally, my boyfriend came

60
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.620
When you cheered for us on the spot, the mega power of the athlete

61
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:08.020
He showed the best performance in the championship game. He scored 16 points in the second set of Game 3, the most in a course season

62
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:16.220
In fact, it's a great record because 12th place is Betty from Jace Caltex

63
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.820
There was a record of showing the championship match against IBK Industrial Bank. Right, I remember this mega player

64
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:30.820
Of course, it was ranked No. 1 in attack success rate during the regular season. Yes, if you look at the first round

65
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.520
There was a bit of a disappointing attack rate and scoring, but yes

66
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.620
When it's important, A.C.E

67
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.420
I'm the player who always plays his role when I have to. That's right. Soon

68
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.620
The player who exploded with Mega

69
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.820
You could pick Banya Bukirich

70
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:55.420
The players who are playing on the court right now, including yellow Yeom Hye-sun, Park Eun-jin, too

71
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.620
There are few players who are not injured but fit. That's right. Well

72
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.020
We can't take out one player, Yellow.

73
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.120
I'm getting painkillers because of my back injury

74
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.720
You can see that receiving is a bit shaky

75
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.820
The strong mentality that you won't just eat as much as you do in the back

76
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.420
It's the yellow player who's showing you. Before the 3rd round match on the day before yesterday

77
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.220
I didn't get a painkiller shot

78
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.020
I'll put everything into the game

79
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.620
I did it with that determination. That's right. I can see it on the screen

80
00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.220
I think I'll start today, too. When I see the movement

81
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.520
First of all, it doesn't seem to have much impact.

82
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.820
Director Ko Hee-jin and Avon-ja

83
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.220
He's the coach who wants to finish today's game, but in the third game

84
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.320
6 in 3 sets, 8 in 4 sets

85
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.320
As Cha Sang-hyun said earlier, as mistakes were made in the most important set

86
00:07:52.320 --> 00:08:00.620
I didn't win that one set, so I came to Game 4 today until Sunday. That's right. In the end, Heungkuk Life Insurance

87
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:07.220
In terms of mistakes, Heungkuk Life is the only team that plays the most salty volleyball

88
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.420
The number of mistakes is more than the articles of incorporation

89
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.920
There were two more. And 3 of us have 25 Bumsik

90
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.320
Director Jeong made 23 mistakes

91
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.320
Director Jeong always made a lot of mistakes

92
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.520
There wasn't much damage because we're a team

93
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.720
For Heungkuk Life, it's a really painful mistake

94
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.620
Yes, and what you can see is that there was an offbeat

95
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.320
Of course, Kim Hyun-kyung scored only three points in the fourth set, but the attack success rate is

96
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.420
It went up a lot more than in the third set.

97
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.420
But in the 4th set, he didn't win Heungkuk Life

98
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.020
I went up to the 5th set. Yes, it's completely different from the second round

99
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.920
Kim Yeon-koung showed a pattern in the 2nd round

100
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.120
1

101
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:54.520
3

102
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.820
He scored 21 points

103
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.820
3

104
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.720
As such a situation unfolded, he eventually lost a game to the president of the articles of association. That's right.

105
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.620
Kim Yeon-koung is also in her mid-30s, so she's recovering

106
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.520
You might be worried about the speed, so with Kim Yeonkyung

107
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.220
For Heungkuk's life, more than that, in this fourth game today

108
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.220
I need to finish this series. Before today's game, we're going to talk about Ko Heejin and Avon Dacha

109
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.780
Announcer Kim Se-yeon met.

110
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:40.160
Let's meet the director of Jeonggwanjang, Ko Hee-jin. As the players showed their fighting spirit, they played a really dramatic game. Surely the atmosphere seems to have been revived a lot since the last game?

111
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:54.880
Your mood has been revived, but I'm sad because the players seem to be having a hard time, but there are thoughts that the players will never give a winning profile at home

112
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.460
I think I'll show my fighting spirit again today.

113
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:03.060
Yes, it was a game where I really felt the will of the players. In the last game, in the clutch situation

114
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.360
Bukirich also showed a remarkable revival.

115
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.360
Are you feeling better?

116
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:16.360
Yes, I think Bukrich has a little less pressure on his ankle now. And

117
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.760
I'm gaining confidence in the attack

118
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.460
As I always say, our coach Kim Jung Hwan

119
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.560
I'm paying attention to both sides. On the offensive side

120
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.560
I hope Bukirich will do well today as well.

121
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:37.360
Yes, and to solidify this atmosphere as it is, we need to gain the upper hand from the beginning. What kind of attack do we need today?

122
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.260
Tactically, it's hard to ask for anything from the players right now. But the serve

123
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:49.360
If we get a good serve, Heungkuk Life will definitely have a lower attack success rate

124
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.260
Then I think a good game will come out.

125
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.760
Yes, we look forward to a great game today. I promise to work hard at it.

126
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.480
We met director Chung and director Ko Hee-jin.

127
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:12.960
Let's meet the director of Heungkuk Life Insurance. He won 12 sets, but unfortunately he couldn't bring a victory. Where do you think the game was decided in the last game?

128
00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:43.220
Yes, even if a crisis comes at such a moment, the role of the center is inevitably important to get back to the center. What kind of order did you place on Lee Goeun?

129
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:10.440
Yes, and in order to end this match today, we need to take the momentum from the beginning. What kind of play do you think it should be?

130
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:22.100
Yes, I look forward to a great match today. We met the director of Heungkuk Life Insurance.

131
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:34.380
It was head coach Ko Hee-jin and Marcello Abondaga, who are in the camp of drainage. the articles of association that laid the groundwork for the reversal.

132
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:45.060
The home winning rate is 68.4% this season, and the away winning rate of Heungkuk Life Daejeon, which is said to be the final destination of the championship, is 50%.

133
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:52.100
However, you just refer to these new medical data. That's right. First of all, you have to be patient with the current situation

134
00:12:52.180 --> 00:13:05.340
It is now very important which team will take the lead in this early atmosphere in today's game. That's right. With superhuman strength, the mind controls the body.

135
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:19.960
Jeong Kwan-jang This is Kim Yeon-koung, the volleyball king of the last dance who dreams of a happy ending for Red Sparks Mega Heungkuk Life. Jeong Kwan-jang Heungkuk Life Heungkuk Life Insurance and Jeong Kwan-jang's women's championship match in the fourth round

136
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.480
I'll be with you in a little while. This is Daejeon.

137
00:13:52.620 --> 00:14:05.260
Do you know why Dodram Han Don is the number one? Experts keep the freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. No. 1 Meister to make Dodram dons

138
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.800
soft money that tastes good to one's taste

139
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:26.180
Dodrami is the lineup of the 4th game of the championship game between Red Sparks and Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders of the V League. Jeonggwanjang's No. 1 seat setter Yeom Hye-sun, this out-of-the-box cybeater Bania Bukirich No. 3 middle blocker Jung Ho-young

140
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:40.020
No. 4 Apogee Piker Mega Auburn Outside Heater Pyo Seung-joo, No. 6 Middle Blocker Park Eun-jin's yellow Rivero, No. 1 spot in Heungkuk Life Biddle Blocker Kim Soo-jin. This Apogee Piker To To Burj Three Outside Heater Jung Hyun-joo Sabon Middle Blocker Anili Speech

141
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:50.600
No. 5 setter Lee Veterans' No. 6 outside heater Kim Hyun-kyung and Libero Shin Yeon-kyung. As expected, the best line-up of both teams is Jung Eui. Yes

142
00:14:50.680 --> 00:15:03.120
Now, referee Kang Joo-hee and assistant referee Choi Sung-kwon were assigned to the fourth match of the championship decision today. Kim Kyung-hoon and Lee Kwang-hoon, the referee, will be with you.

143
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.200
Look at the momentum right now

144
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.100
From what I see, Jeong Kwan-ja is at its peak.

145
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.200
Game 3... Let's try to solve the crisis in that difficult situation

146
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.300
It's a sweet soy sauce that I've overcome

147
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.500
First of all, the atmosphere looks good, but Heungkuk Life is not easy. That's right.

148
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.900
That's why today's game

149
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.900
The team that wins the first set

150
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:29.900
Looking at the overall picture, I think it will be a very important factor. That's right. First of all, I told you in advance.

151
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:37.200
Again, this physical part definitely works to some extent, so the atmosphere at the beginning of the first set is quite important. That's right.

152
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.100
Heungkuk Life Insurance's Pinks Virus Leading the Series With 2 wins and 1 loss

153
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:49.700
With today's match, Kim Su-ji became the most participant in a V-League postseason ever. The 52nd game

154
00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.500
It's going to hit and fall. Bukirich scores the first attack of Bukirich. That's why today's Jeonggwanjang

155
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.400
It's a very meaningful first score. Right. First of all, Voceris

156
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:09.200
Game 3 began to pick up from the third set and eventually caught the game. Yeah

157
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.400
Boo-Carrie, who had a twist in the last game

158
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.340
Jung Yoon takes it back at once. Yes

159
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:35.280
We start with Jung Yoon-joo's first score. If you look at Jung Yoon personally, he has actually grown enough to take charge of one left seat in the national team along with his rapid growth this season.

160
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:43.420
That's right. It's a one-on-one tie. One-handed connection, see-through, beag. This is a tie

161
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:56.760
You can't hold this ball. When the score starts to be scored in the pitch scoring movement attack, the brokers of the articles of association are having a hard time. Yes, it's good in the beginning. That's right.

162
00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:09.240
At this time, Yeom Hye-sun's center went up too long to catch the ball. It's actually not a big deal if there's no pressure on that knee, but yes, I'm having quite a hard time because of my knee injury. Lee Yeon-seok will make poetry difficult. high-cheeked

163
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:24.080
Memo players also make first base points. Jung Kwan-jang's fans now know, but if the success rate of Lee Mega and Bookies' one-two punch falls to a certain extent, Heungkuk Life will be the winner. Right.

164
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:35.060
Mega's Score 2 to 2 Third Place Kim Hyun-kyung and Lee Bo-eun go to tight. Take

165
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:49.740
It's one of the Heungkuk Life patterns that Park Eun-jin likes to use, and Park Eun-jin waited very long. It was an accurate reading block for the pipe attack on the pitch right now. That's right. Now

166
00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:58.700
To some extent, I keep all the opposing plays in mind. That's how it's seen. That's right. It was Park Engine who scored 7 points in the third game.

167
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.300
Let's do this again. That's the source. Good

168
00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:14.380
It was a no-mark right now. That's right. Because he had one, Park Eun-jin was in a situation where he kept the other side in check, but Ye Lee Gu-won's stubbornness made one point. That's right.

169
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:24.980
Lee Go-eun, who took Cho Teuk-ho's pipe once again, goes from yellow south to white time with Jung Yoon-joo, who is tied at 3 to 3 setters.

170
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:41.280
The voluntary reception was good, and the mega player takes the perfect setting of Yeom Mi-sun Center. Yes, the yellow player showed very stable receiving accuracy. After creating a one-on-one situation, it was Mega's ending.

171
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:50.080
4

172
00:18:50.380 --> 00:19:02.160
Turn it over with perspective. Shin Hyun-kyung gets it and number 2 is a bigger rice-out perm room on the left. Oh, Pyo-seung reached out. Rather

173
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:10.900
It looks like it went out of the line because it didn't fit, but yes, I'm checking the manager. It's a video review of the defensive touch.

174
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:24.880
The defensive touch is difficult to see in the Korean Life Team, so we asked for a video review of the defender's touchout. Manager Avontanza wants to see if it's a defender touch.

175
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:32.840
Pyo Seung-joo's left arm on No.3 and No.4 as it deflected off Vectar

176
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:46.320
The hardest video reading was actually this defender touch house.

177
00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.980
Shall we look at it from this side?

178
00:19:51.300 --> 00:20:01.700
It's very difficult. I'm looking at all the front and back screens, and I think this is a situation that only Pyo Seung-joo himself can know.

179
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:16.020
If the lower court is out, it will be Jeong Kwan-jang's score. Yes, the screen is better visible now. has been identified as touch-out.

180
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:31.060
I got hit and left. First of all, the defense is very difficult to see, but on a slow screen, I saw a scene where it was slightly bent after being hit by the left hand of the standard player. There is a difference in the trajectory of this ball and a difference in rotation. That's right. Yes

181
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.960
4

182
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:47.460
As you sleep, you go to the left creager punt. My teeth are out. Now I hit Tutko on the shoulder in seat 1. That's right. If Lee Goeun didn't hit the ball in the front, the ball would have been pushed toward the end line

183
00:20:47.540 --> 00:21:01.100
Two players hit each other and went out. That's right. First of all, at the beginning of the game, both teams are becoming side-out pack right now. That's right. First of all, my condition isn't bad. I shook Pyo Seung-joo's class briefly. It was hard to draw a line.

184
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:15.560
I made a difficult connection to the back space, and I'm passing it over. Chance Bowl Jeonggwanjang Yeom Hye-sun Two-Star Fielder Cage Blocking Under-Lind Connection. Shin Hyun-kyung received it from the back and Kim Hyun digs it to the left

185
00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:26.220
You guys have one or two chances coming up, but you keep taking some normal play and making it cool. Yeah

186
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:33.740
It was a mega that was preparing to block with 5 bindings, but it was a very small space. That's right. a five-to-five tie

187
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.500
Director Marcello Avon complex

188
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:47.120
The third yellow of this veterans received it, and it was behind the banquet ship Abey stonemason.

189
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:54.260
There is only a knife line. From the "Sft to Mega Digger" to the server type

190
00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:08.060
Mega player really doesn't get tired. Yes, there was actually only about one or two steps after the defense, but after receiving that space again, he makes it again with a score. That's right.

191
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:21.020
This aspect is very impressive. Of course, I'm happy that I scored in the end, but it's a score that can inspire my teammates to cheer up. Yes, Park Hyun-jin's defense of 6 to 5 weeks was too long.

192
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.200
Yeom Hye-sun who touches me in the past

193
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:33.620
Heungkuk Life is not connected right now. I don't know. It came directly to Yeom Hye-sun, but I thought it was possible to cover it

194
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:47.940
You have to be careful with these cheeks. That's right. First, it didn't become Jung Yoon-joo's lease. Kim Hyun-kyung did not get enough of the second touch. Shin Hyun-kyung comes out to greet Park Eun-jin

195
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:59.760
How many times did you open this? It's going up too long. From the left, the groove is a large ball attack. Here we go again. Choi Seung-joo scored one step home big hit

196
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.640
Shin Hyunkyung did a great job of choosing the location

197
00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:15.140
The ball almost didn't rotate. How should I say this? They score points by showing the intensity of taking it off with their fists. But Heungkuk Life is one of Kim Yeon-koung's main options

198
00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:17.240
When the 4th seat opens quickly

199
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.540
Actually, I prefer the ball that Kim Hyunkyung puts on the net

200
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:28.040
It's not just sticking, but it's almost a ball that goes over. That's right. If you move on like that, Kim Hyunkyung might feel a bit overwhelmed

201
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.840
If only half of my cheeks fell off

202
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.540
It's hard to defend because it passes from this side. Yes

203
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.540
Jeong Kwan-jang scored in a row, and now the score is

204
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.540
8

205
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.500
It was Pyo Seungjoo's underhand pass. In the 2nd block

206
00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:53.180
As Bukirchi continued to talk about Cha Sang-hyun during the third game the day before yesterday, there were many RBIs that hit the ball throughout the game.

207
00:23:53.260 --> 00:24:00.860
Game 3 was like that, and I remember the 2nd game even more when you're holding your 12th set

208
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.940
When Creech's mistake came out

209
00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.640
Director Jeong's mood completely dropped

210
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:12.240
I lost the game. There were 6 mistakes in the 4th set. Like Bukirich

211
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:18.940
Not only the mental but also the physical content completely collapsed. I used to be a Bukirit player who completely collapsed

212
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.940
It's become a completely different bouquinich. That's right. 8 to 5 3 points

213
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.640
It shakes with the root of the head. Open stone to the left

214
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.440
It's going to hit and fall. First of all, Kim Hyunkyung

215
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:35.640
It's not that Heungkuk Life hasn't been swayed by receiving, but it's not that they've been shaken

216
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.540
Toogoo Kim Yeon-koung and Jung Yoon-soo

217
00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.440
As Triangle Hyundai played an active role

218
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.740
I erased the receiving that was shaking. Yes, we need to quickly erase this.

219
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:52.340
6

220
00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:07.880
Jung Ho-young. Perhaps Jung Ho-young is the player who plays more than his role in the center when he enters the championship. That's right. Hoyoung's short fastball score

221
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:19.400
He is Jung Ho-young, who is not only an attack but also has the power of breaking that he can catch occasionally. In Game 3, it was Jung Ho-young who scored eight points. It's going to be 100 o'clock. It fell behind the ball. But it does. Tutu, tutu

222
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.280
The return of Tutank was not 100%, but yes

223
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.480
It was a little difficult to catch the block because he is a two-to-pee player who uses this wrist well.

224
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.480
Before we go into today's game, Rep. Cha Sung-hyun

225
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.980
The most important thing for Heungkuk Life is

226
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:39.580
It was about whether Lee Go-eun would take the center stage. That's right. So, when the mental state that we're talking about is shaken

227
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:45.660
Heungkuk Life can shake the whole thing. Yes, it's Kim Suzy's class. The score is two points apart. Three balls are good

228
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:57.640
Yeom Hye-sun is a very aggressive choice. I don't know if Heungkuk Life Insurance is intentional right now, but he's targeting the yellow player

229
00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:12.080
You're holding up very well, and Yeom Hye-sun center is taking the overall play well. Right. Vukrich serves right away. Tagger pen dig to the left. Now, counterattack situation. One star big pen

230
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:24.840
Here we go. We're running away. The bowling play was long to the left. The cloth floats the back space of the fight, Kim Hyun-kyung.

231
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:30.020
Let's go to the front of the Song Yoon-ju Blocking Cover Bookie Rich. Old Seungju District

232
00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:41.780
Following Key Shin Hyun-kyung's really picturesque defense, Kim Yeon-kyung's last treatment was very far away. Yes, this makes another score.

233
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:54.240
Wow, it was really picturesque Yellie. That's right. It was quite far away, but I caught it again and moved on. Right, Shin Hyunkyung and Kim Hyunkyung who showed incredible play

234
00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:08.640
8

235
00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:18.640
I'm getting into the attack line. Yes, how should I say this? The receiving came a little faster, so it didn't come into my hands exactly. The score of 11 to 8 is 3 points

236
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.440
Jung Ho-young's own money

237
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:30.980
Jung Yoon-joo receives and blocks the mobile attack. Jung Ho-young and Yeom Hye-sun are thin. It's a mega hit with a one-footed shot.

238
00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.800
Here we go again. a mobile attack

239
00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.860
I got it. Now

240
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:47.020
Perhaps Park Eun-jin accurately read the pattern of moving attacks and created two-broke. Time Out Heungkuk Life Insurance Co., Ltd

241
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.600
Manager Subundaganda also said that he would hit the serve towards Libero in the middle of the operation, but in the end

242
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:31.400
Uh, I didn't mean to hit Libero Lorna first, but I think he just turned in that direction. Yeah

243
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:46.080
The points are Jeong Kwan-jang's players, who continue to target Jung Yoon-joon with a four-point gap between 12 and 8 points. That's right. Here we go again. Jung Yoon-ju, Lee Dong-wook, Tae Cover, who got the score difference, connected with difficulty in the second inning

244
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.800
Open girl hit for a long time

245
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:53.300
I got it. I got a new one. The light-on is a one-star folk star.

246
00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:08.420
I used a broker, but even if Yeom Hye-sun is in the back, there is no problem at all if her hand doesn't come over the net. I think Avodanza will check this out

247
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:15.980
You just have to do a video review of the homadae, but do you hold it in for now?

248
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:22.420
First of all, Kim Hyun-kyung is talking to referee Kang Joo-hee. This is enough to ask.

249
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.420
If you're in doubt, you can read it. Right, Kim Hyunkyung is

250
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:41.880
Since Kim Soo-ji is out, she is playing the role of captain and asking referee Ye Kang Joo-hee for now. That's right. Only the captain can play among the players on the court. Yes, if you get out of the argument

251
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.100
The second captain is Kim Yeon-koung right now, so he can limit himself.

252
00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.160
For your information, Yeom Hye-sun setter was in a later situation. That's right. Yes

253
00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:07.080
With Heungkuk Life Insurance's appeal play continuing, the game was suspended for a while. Yes, manager Avonjada is drawing a square and asking for a video review

254
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:20.440
Choi Sung-kwon said it's unacceptable timing. It's because it was a mid-rally situation. That's right. The score of 3 to 8 is 5 points. Jung Ho Young's serve

255
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.440
I take it underhand and go with this type. It's a line line. Two, two

256
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.240
Heungkuk Life succeeded in a side-out with a lot of difficulty.

257
00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:43.980
If you look at it, the big option is to have a pipe in the middle. It's actually too fast for your side brokers to participate, so it's hard, but if you can't cover the defense from the back, just

258
00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:50.400
It's a pipe that leads directly to the dot. That's right. 9 to 13 Jung Yunju's Sog No. 6 spot

259
00:30:51.940 --> 00:31:02.900
When you look at the movement of the setter, Hyum Hye-sun, it looks lighter than the third game. Yes, I'm using Park Eun-jin in front of me and behind Jung Ho-young.

260
00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:12.360
It was a little bit of a distance, but it's perfect with the success of the bag. Mega's class 9 to 14 Biffen Blocked Out to the Left

261
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:24.400
In the end, as long as the ball that goes up toward Kim Hyun-kyung is easily scored, it is actually the easiest score because Yeom Hye-sun is in the front. Right.

262
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:34.600
In addition, Heungkuk Life Insurance also intensively targets this part when Yeom Hye-sun passes three previous positions. That's right. a gaseous cut

263
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.480
The rear attack pitch of the robbery spreads in the South Sea. Direct King

264
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:50.920
Pyo Seung-joo made a point, but it's a shame that the pitch player's defensive control is very disappointing. Yes, director Ko Heejin

265
00:31:51.360 --> 00:32:01.700
The score is 5 points apart. In a way, it's an invisible mistake. That's right. The rebound was this good. Yes

266
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:10.980
It's a back-to-back score. Jung Yunjoo's receiving is a bit shaky in the first set

267
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:24.060
It's okay if this doesn't come out perfectly, but yes, if you allow the score like this, the pressure will inevitably increase. That's right. After winning the reverse sweep in the third round

268
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:37.920
Jeong Kwan-jang's tremendous momentum continues at the beginning of Game 4 today. That's right. First of all, the first set is not over yet, but it seems to have succeeded to some extent. Yes, Hyo Seungjo's serve ace

269
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:50.680
I keep making Jung Yoon-joo difficult with a target serve. It doesn't seem like a strong serve, but to be a completely clumsy player

270
00:32:50.760 --> 00:33:03.460
It is also somewhat physically distant. The hardest part is actually the lower body. If you don't support your lower body, it could shake like now. We'll have to wait and see

271
00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:18.500
Jung Yoon-joo seems to be getting a little physical damage. Before recording a serve ace a little while ago, Pyo Seung-joo used to show his sincerity in the ball to hit his serve. back-to-back serve by the winner

272
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:27.540
It goes into the red of the 2nd ball. It's an Egon center that's taking the option of the rear rather than the option of the transfer inside the line.

273
00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.820
11

274
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.820
First of all, Heungkuk Life is

275
00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.620
I'm going to make a more central point in my previous play

276
00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.020
What changes do we need to make to find it? First of all

277
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:44.220
I think Kim Soo-jin's moving attack should also come out clearly. Jeong Jin's reception is

278
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:52.420
You have to hold on to play. Right. It's the first Lunar New Year's Day, but if you look at it the other way, Yeom Hye-sun setter

279
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:58.420
When I come up to this side, I'm using both Jung Ho-young and Park Eun-jin in the center

280
00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.420
Since the lease fee is shaking

281
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.420
I can see Duke Peach's moving attack right now, but yes

282
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.680
At the bottom, Kim Soo-jin's attack share is almost nonexistent now. That's right.

283
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:23.380
It's an important tool to see how much Kim Soo-ji can be used in the middle. Shin In-jae is shaking. Kim Su-ji's acting, one-star Kim Yeon-koung is the base. There's more. JUNG HOYOUNG's receiving

284
00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:33.060
Heungkuk Life Insurance is a little disappointed because it's shaken and you can't play and get blocked. Heungkuk Life Time Out

285
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:53.620
You're not under any pressure. You're supposed to hit the serve or whatever you want

286
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:10.440
There are a lot of factors to catch that game, but based on the overall flow of the first set, Coach Avon Daza

287
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:22.880
We talked about the importance of serving once again. That's right. Compared to Heungkuk Life Insurance, which does not play, Jeong Kwan-jang's play is doing so well, so he emphasizes that the strength of the serve should be clearly increased. That's right. Shin In Jae's serve is back again. Jung Yun Ju

288
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:35.540
You get two balls in front of the long and big consecutive hits and give them to the back of the ticket. Two-step, five-event ball, four-carry south of the line. Since it's coming into the air

289
00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:46.560
Heungkuk Life seems to be a little embarrassed in the first set. Yes, the score also proves the content. That's right. It's almost 3 li breaking right now, but I'm drilling it again. Yes

290
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.020
19 to 11

291
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.380
Shin Eun-ji has been attractive since her third consecutive appearance.

292
00:35:51.740 --> 00:36:03.740
Two minutes later, the Fever fan touch out 2 to four touches and the Yes touch is Heungkuk Life of a mistake. Now, the score for the first set is Sco-A

293
00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:17.520
The atmosphere has completely shifted to director Jeong. That's right. After the attack, he hit four strokes without being centered. That was also before the ball was dead. That's right. I'm very confident in my 20s and 11th consecutive class.

294
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.880
You've completely found your confidence. Kim Hyun-kyung paint pancakes Oh, my feet won't fall off.

295
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.160
First, Kim Hyunkyung made a score

296
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.760
Heungkuk Life Insurance's play is

297
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.960
It's not coming out at all

298
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.660
In a way, I have no choice but to see a situation where I am making a hard score. That's right.

299
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.360
Kim Hyun-kyung succeeds in a side-out with exquisite paint

300
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.760
Heungkuk Life Insurance needs to target its serve. That's right. 12 to 20 Kim Hyunkyung's Third

301
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:51.040
That's right. The serve is good. Shake a lot. To the left, Pokey Reach. Okay

302
00:36:51.840 --> 00:37:06.520
After all, it's this. When you shake the opponent's receiver to some extent, breaking, the longest that Heungkuk Life has, comes out. I like Jungchan's comment on the tie-out. It's right away

303
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:16.020
Hoyoung, so when Yeon-kyung serves two-took, you always have to prepare short ones. Until the end of the series, go to sleep

304
00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:29.020
When Yeon-kyung serves well, connect her well and do a short caba for a few seconds. See? I told you I'm going to give you a tip. I'm going to give you a tip from today. I'm skipping it

305
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.100
Let's go.

306
00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:41.140
The coaches and players of both teams already know how to target through meetings or video analysis. Yes, but that

307
00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:56.140
It's a fight like whether you can hold out and catch it or not, but the timing was very good now. That's right. In addition, head coach Ko Yoo-jin said Kim Hyun-kyung will mix a lot of consecutive hits as well as hitting from Game 4 today That's what I said. That's right. I'm going to the left.

308
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.780
Wow, Bukirich

309
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:14.300
I'm fully back from the second half of the last Game 3. The scariest thing is that the biggest strikers, especially Bukrich, have a basic height

310
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:28.980
You're not a higher jumper than those who just jump. That's right. Then how should I say this all the time? A jumper who jumps like a leveller has less physical burden than a player who runs a lot. That's right. You can't hit Shin Hyun-kyung's pass. JUNG HO YOUNG got the chance ball

311
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.500
It's the first ball from the kite. This is a beag

312
00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:48.420
Jung Yoon-joo's chance timing came once again, but Yeom Hye-sun once again chose Jung Woo-young, but was countered. Jung Yoon-joo knows that the two-broking is coming perfectly and pushes and hits it accurately. That's right.

313
00:38:48.500 --> 00:39:02.300
Jung Yoon-ju, who pushes for a long time, is Jung Yoon-jun, the second player in today's game. He's playing his 52nd post-season game of all time

314
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:19.960
Now, Yeom Hye-sun setter is actually increasing the market share toward Bookies rather than Mega in the first set. Yes, I'm director Ko Won-jin who asks for a video review. Oh, the beach player is really high. Choi Hong-ryeon is really good.

315
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:30.240
The articles of association team requested a video review of Netachi. You have requested a video review of the touchnet.

316
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.820
After 3 blockers come up

317
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:58.940
The ball was quickly heading to the ground. It has been confirmed as a winning move. Yes, it wasn't touchnits. I don't see the net shaking at all. Your score is 15 to 21

318
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:05.580
Kim Hyun-kyung, who was sharing Ando's high-fives, pitch Kim Soo-jil serve after pitching

319
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:16.100
We're going to Yeom Hye-sun's Baek-si. It's done after the facial mask.

320
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:31.000
I opened it to the yellow left and held a zigzag step mega. Take it out in a straight line. So, when the game goes well, even if the connection goes up a little dull, the Mega and Bookies score easily. Right.

321
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:44.960
Just like now, yes, set 1 is exactly like that right now. Yes, the straight side was completely open right now. That's right. Yes Petrich's serve error came in low, but the ball was pushed too far. Yes

322
00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.660
Actually, Bucherix covered it a bit

323
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.360
On that day, when you're feeling something up and down

324
00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.660
I'm the type that gets influenced

325
00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:02.160
In the case of the day before yesterday, it was said that it was difficult because of that. That's right. Directors and colleagues on the court, too

326
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.160
It was a situation where I had no choice but to be self-conscious. Right.

327
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:13.160
Now, it's off the line again. Rather, I can see Jeong Kwan-jang's players a little anxious now. Yes

328
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.460
Now, 17 to 225

329
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.500
It was an underhand pass in the kite, and Mega's offense that turned diagonally

330
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:34.280
Lee Hye-rim is now in the position of Lee Go-eun, reinforcing the height. That's right. Now, let's see where Jeong Kwan-jang will go on the attack course after the resig.

331
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:43.200
The reception is shaky. I can't hit the center rear attack. It wasn't easy for Lee Hye-rim to connect after receiving the chance ball. Sung Yunjoo's drumming streak

332
00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.920
Dockerich's left

333
00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:51.320
Seungjoo Cho's eye makeup cover. Mega eye makeup cover with yellow maxi

334
00:41:52.180 --> 00:42:01.540
Let's go again, Yeom Hye-sun. The connection between the sale team and the situation of hitting with the left foot was a little dull right now. Heungkuk Life Insurance Co., Ltd

335
00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:14.440
As Lee Dong-hoon went out, a chance ball came once, but the sign of the connection was not right, and he was countered. Yes, this ball was shorter than the exact connection, but in the end, Mega scores with his individual skills.

336
00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:28.880
That's right. 23 to 17 In fact, from the current trend, it was a valuable side-out score for Jeong Kwan-jang. That's right. If this had gone to Heungkuk Life, it could have been a little difficult in the first set. Jung Soojin's sub

337
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:40.360
In order to eventually create this score in the front of the moving attack line, the pitch player continued to attempt the moving attack from the beginning of the first set. That's right. Especially from the beginning of today's game

338
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:46.620
This setter used a lot of pitch movement attack options. Right.

339
00:42:47.240 --> 00:43:02.200
Park Soo-hyun, the game changer, is coming in. You have to tap Park Soo-hyun and Su-ah, who came into Jung Yoon-joo's position, with a strong serve of 18 to 23. Right, Park Suhyun. Good Corky Reitch, by chance

340
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:15.200
Here we go. The time difference is coming in, and the mega on the Lina side is coming in short, but even though Kim Hyun-kyung noticed and moved inside together, the RBI doesn't drop at all.

341
00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:29.160
That's right. Kim Hyun-kyung also took a step forward. Yes, you bend your wrist toward the long course again. Representative Cha Sang-hyun explained that, so I can see the movement of Kim Hyun-kyung, who leaves the straight line empty and follows it. That's right.

342
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.580
The girl is Ahn Yerim Jung's generous 3 points

343
00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:46.660
The initial position of Mega's servitude is long. A chance to finish the set. After An Yerin's center, she didn't breathe, but she couldn't pass it over. Aha, I'm not sure. First of all, Ahn Hyerim

344
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:57.920
I think I felt a little burdened. Again, setter Yeom Hye-sun is going in. It was a perfect chance, but I fell back too much. Yes

345
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.600
19 to 24

346
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:14.500
Choi Hyun-ji is also here. That's right. He is Choi Hyun-ji, who has three serve aces in the championship alone. Yes, I met him before today's game and Choi Hyun-ji said that. I wish I had a stronger serve earlier

347
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:22.260
He said it's a bummer. It's strong. Choi Hyunjae's serve is good. Light phager tek. Long distance tek

348
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.060
Lee Goeun, Kim Hyunkyung, take care of your ears

349
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:39.820
First of all, Chae Won-ji's sub-tempo was successful. It's director Ko Heejin who breaks the rhythm

350
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:54.720
Let's focus on the connection. If the ball sticks, we can do the next one, but it can't fall off too much. I like that one

351
00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:03.460
It's Hye-sun. There's nothing complicated. Always ready to connect with the most basic play. Ready to connect

352
00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:16.540
It's best to stick to the basics. Yes, right now, if you succeed one out of four times, you will now take the first set. Right, Choi Eun Ji is trying to serve right now

353
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:31.360
Whether to take it strongly or not, the short side can be attacked now, but this sub is very important. That's right. Jeong Kwan-jang is only one point away from winning the set, and he is behind Choi Hyun-ji in his 20s and 24s.

354
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:44.180
Uh, a sub mistake. Try hard while doing a strategy time. Yes, Choi Hyun-jin tried more boldly because such a plan could have been made. That's right.

355
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:53.140
Jung Kwan Jang Lansparks to win the first set at home in Game 4 of today's championship game. I'll see you in a little while. It's Daejeon.

356
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.700
Do you know why money is the number one?

357
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:17.580
Experts keep the freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. The Meister Who Makes Money with a Board Favourite Taste Board and Money Age of Youth

358
00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:23.280
It's a perfect age to see the second child. It's the perfect age to get a new job.

359
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:29.920
Insurance plays a longer role for your longer youth. Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd

360
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:45.800
We are with commentator Cha Sang-hyun at Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon. Set 1. In a way, you said that winning the first set is the most important thing in today's game, but Director Jung became the main character.

361
00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:59.780
That's right. First of all, it could be the most important atmosphere and maybe everyone knows about it in today's game, but it seems that Jeong Kwan-jang pushed it a little bit with an attack. Right.

362
00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.580
There was little difference in attack success rate

363
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:16.920
In terms of receiving efficiency, Heungkuk Life's receiving continued to falter until the middle of the first set in the middle of the game. That's right. This part is where Lee Gwon is taking Peach's mobile attack

364
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:25.380
The breaking height of the Jeonggwanjeong right now is never low because that part of the remaining big strikers is not being done smoothly right now. Yes

365
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:39.680
I think that's a situation where players eventually take damage. After 20 points, Heungkuk Life had the highest attack success rate, but in fact, the lead that Jeong Kwan-jang held until the middle of the set was narrow

366
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.460
I continued that. That's right. In the end, we set the mood in the beginning

367
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.760
It's the articles of association that I didn't give out until the end of the set. Yes

368
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.960
Through the first set, Mega scored the most points with eight points.

369
00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.660
And he made only one mistake, and Bukereich

370
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.560
Heungkuk Life scored four points and failed two times

371
00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:06.360
Kim Hyun-kyung scored six points and showed a flawless game. So overall, I'm taking all the attack options that I can take to both teams, but yes

372
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:10.860
How should I say this? At the beginning of the set

373
00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.560
There were a lot of situations where we hit and hit

374
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:17.960
In the end, it's about how much you take today for the serve.

375
00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.160
Today's game can determine the winner or loser

376
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:25.560
That's the situation. Right. You're watching the line-up of the 2nd set

377
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.160
Heungkuk Life Insurance's setter Lee Go-hoon starts at the rear 6.

378
00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.660
In Jeonggwanjang, Yeom Hye-sun starts at No. 1. That's right.

379
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:39.360
In fact, director Jung is in the lineup after Yeom Hye-sun has to continue serving

380
00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:46.760
At this time, you have to score the most points in a row. Well, that's inevitable because if you look at the breaking height of the articles of association

381
00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:52.160
You, Bukirich Jung Ho-young took the highest position in Korean women's volleyball

382
00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.260
So you have to score four times in a row

383
00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:59.560
That's the situation. Jeonggwanjang, who needs to go to Incheon, needs to finish in Daejeon today

384
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.840
It's Heungkuk Life. Number one sub, Yeom Hye-sun

385
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:15.940
We will go back to the order of Bulich Jung Ho-young and Mega Pyo Seung-joo Park Eun-jin. For Jaheungguk Life, the beginning of the second set became very important. Yes, let's go with this set.

386
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:23.440
It's short on the banquet line. Make sure to stand out from the left side

387
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:31.640
One-handed connection yellow goes over. Double-cleaning on top of the shine-for-like row

388
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.900
Yes Request a video review of the interim rally.

389
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:39.100
The ball went over in the middle and Lee Dong Hoon went up and got hit

390
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.400
I judged that I was right, and I judged that I was right on my way down. Right.

391
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:47.800
I requested a video review for a double contact with a lag. It's about double contact with time difference

392
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.880
It's a video review. If it's right, it's a double contact. Yes

393
00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.280
Shall we take a look?

394
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:09.620
I took my hand out and got hit here. After being punched, he comes down with his left hand and goes back up with his right hand.

395
00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:19.940
As a result of the reading, it was confirmed as a double contact. Yes, in the end, it was the content that lawmaker Cha Sang-hyun explained.

396
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:27.740
First of all, the double contact is definitely correct, but now I'm the director of Avalanche, who is requesting a video review of Overnet. That's right.

397
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.040
I'm asking for a video review of the same rally, but a different element, Overnet

398
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:40.380
Choi Sung-kwon, the assistant referee, is explaining it with an interpreter. That's right. This is the part about the virtue of justice. Yes

399
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:58.300
Manager Ko Hee-jin of Jeong Kwan-jang has already read the middle rally

400
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:10.560
Now, because there was no longer a connection there, the emphasis USIM accepts the parts of this rereading. That's right. If director Ko Hee-jin applied for a video review after the rally ended, not an interim rally

401
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:22.280
You can bet this on other factors. That's right. Of course, you have to accept it. But it was a mid-term reading now, and because the results came out, we are not accepting additional video readings. That's right. Yes

402
00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.880
Heungkuk Life Team has requested additional reading of Overnet.

403
00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.020
You can look at it. Yes

404
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.740
In the end, I accepted the video review of Overnet.

405
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:49.400
Now, when Bukirich's hand touches the ball, there seems to be nothing wrong. The senior results have confirmed that it is not overnet. Bukirich's ball is a close game

406
00:51:49.480 --> 00:52:04.320
If you look at the area where the ball touches the hand, if part of your ball comes over toward the court of the articles of association, it's not Omanet. That's right. In the video review of both teams, joy and sorrow are completely crossed right now. 1 to 0

407
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:19.620
So in the end, because it was Yeom Hye-sun who was preparing for the stonemason in the front, the pipe in the middle was so low that there was no time to position the defense. That's right.

408
00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:25.520
That's why it's easier to score if you quickly attack the first one. a one-on-one tie

409
00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:35.820
Sua Bank's Kim Soo-jin is going to pay rent after the yellow banquet

410
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:46.800
Kim Soo-jin's serve was quite good right now, but Yellow was holding up very well. This isn't a bad serve right now. Yes

411
00:52:46.880 --> 00:53:01.780
Now, Sunghyun Cha. Then the first set was already a target serve for this pattern of yellow, but the game continues. It's going to the Pi Seok Ball. Throw a yellow body. I caught it. The ball went over. I grabbed the Payseok ball again

412
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.380
Oh, that's smart.

413
00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:13.760
So, do Heungkuk Life servers need to change the target of the target sub? Yes, if you're not a Bukirich player

414
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.460
If you target Pyo Seungjoo

415
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:21.160
It may be more effective, but I keep targeting the yellow hand anyway.

416
00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.860
Jung Yoon-ju's ear is tied at 2 to 2

417
00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:32.460
This time, I'll take a short break and turn around

418
00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.560
Maybe, if Rishi becomes a player, Mega

419
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.460
The fact that I came in so short is that I decided to come in even now. Yes

420
00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:45.160
Now, if it takes this long or that long to move, it's moving. Right.

421
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:49.380
3

422
00:53:49.540 --> 00:54:01.040
Yeah, I got it underhand and I like it. I'm Jung Yoon-joo, who approaches big and big. Jung Woo Young is also serving towards Kim Hyunkyung

423
00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:13.120
First of all, I would have chosen Jung Yoon-joo, but as the direction went, Jung Yoon-soo was so open as an offensive step That's right. Jeong Yunjoo who goes backwards

424
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:21.920
Oh, I'm out of line, but I definitely need that strong serve from Jung Yoon. Yes

425
00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.740
Jung Yunjoo scored 4 points in today's game

426
00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:35.100
The first mistake came out. This time, Mega has a good 69% success rate for one mistake today The serve is good.

427
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:41.200
The under is unable to lift and hit. Let's ask for a chance ball. Lerman's Spé

428
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:54.400
In fact, Heungkuk Life Insurance didn't predict that, but when we talk about it, Yum-min says it's definitely a speculation. That's right. He completely deceived 6 players into Heungkuk Life.

429
00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:03.100
That's right. I didn't expect Jeon Yu's pitch at all. That's right. The 5 to 3 score is a two point gap

430
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:09.720
No. 6 Shin Hyun-kyung passed this time, and she jumps and goes to the left. One-stop Yoo Seungjun

431
00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:19.800
This was the same situation, but Lee Kun-ho's pass painting was completely noticed by the yellow player

432
00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:34.840
As it scores again, director Jung's court atmosphere becomes brighter. That's right. Wow, Jeong Kwan-jang changed completely after overcoming Game 3. That's right. Let's move on after getting hit with the best. Left 2nd base Kim Hyunkyung Tink

433
00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:40.840
Yellow light bagger frame. I'll throw two pitches from the back

434
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:46.760
I turned it over with both hands. I heard that Charles Four's Liger is running.

435
00:55:48.220 --> 00:56:01.800
Compared to Heungkuk Life Insurance, which is getting very difficult to connect, Director Jung seems to score now without knowing something with each ball that goes up. That's right. This is the difference in mood. Actually, Bukirchi's

436
00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:08.040
Even before the central rear-end attack, he could pass the life bike tag, but he hit Mega.

437
00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:09.740
I have it.

438
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:25.120
Mega created an ace hoping for Kim Yeon-kyung. This is a situation where the atmosphere of the articles of association gets better unconditionally. This is the articles of association that completely grabs the momentum today. That's right. The score is 8 to 3

439
00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:32.960
It's a situation where Jeong Kwan-jang, who set the mood once, is not in the mood to present it at all. Yes

440
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:46.660
Heungkuk Life Insurance, which was not likely to lose until the 12th round, but the atmosphere has subsided a lot now. The atmosphere of Jung Kwan's court continued from the 2nd to the 4th round of the regular league

441
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:58.340
It's similar to the atmosphere when you win 13 games in a row. That's right. Mega and Bukris' one-ter punches really bother the other team

442
00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:02.680
Oh, there was a bullying that I couldn't do. That's right.

443
00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:15.500
Coach Ko Hee-jin's mega ace, who clenched his fists, roared loudly when he burst. Everything's going well for the other strikers and defenders, but yeah

444
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:30.080
If you look at today's game so far, it seems that it's probably a battle between serve and receiving. That's right. Isn't it the most important factor in every game of volleyball? That's right. It's basic. Let's listen to the reservation together. It was a powerful serve in front of men's soccer

445
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.300
It became a practice. Scoring Kim Hyun-kyung

446
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:44.980
There's nothing to eat. Jeong Kwan-jang players, Kim Hyun-kyung is also making goals, and Heungkuk Life Insurance seems to need to change the overall atmosphere on the court. Right.

447
00:57:45.380 --> 00:58:00.080
Kim Hyun-kyung succeeded in a side-out that takes it in a straight line toward the low banquet line. Four to eight pitch sub-receiving Jung Hwan, go left to see through. I'm going to defend the players. The 2nd one is to the left

448
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:09.100
Kim Hyun-kyung is ready for paint and Baek Geon-tae, Okurich push Kim Hyun-kyung. I opened the left side. Kim Hyun-kyung's Tig

449
00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:13.640
I've got Muntari back from the salt. Yeah

450
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.300
I like Kim Youngjae

451
00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.760
right

452
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:29.100
Kim Hyun-kyung's defensive concentration creates four more points because Heungkuk Life's Kim Yeon-kyung is in the avant-garde. That's right. In a really difficult situation

453
00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:42.880
It's Kim Hyun-kyung, who plays the ace role. In a way, it's Kim Hyun-kyung's lost list, right? Heungkuk Life, which is trailing by 5 to 83 points, is strong. I don't know if it's this car

454
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:53.600
Well, the strength of the serve is really strong right now, and now the bookies and yellow players are all getting it. That's right. At this point

455
00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:07.080
If you turn a little toward Pyo Seung-joo, you can see an effect. Yes, if so, we'll have to see when Heungkuk Life's servers will win or move to the target of the target serve toward Pyo Seung-joo.

456
00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:21.660
Throwing the bagger tab means that the open paint ball connected behind Choi Seung-joo in yellow is alive. In the background, a megahit and a light cloth scores the National Assembly. To the court

457
00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:27.000
In the middle of the National Assembly, we're talking about pancake defense

458
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:37.400
I had a lot of thoughts about whether to press it or not on the bench side, but yes, I passed by and Bukiri catches it again. Shin Hyun-kyung's pancake movement was right here.

459
00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:51.500
Shin Young-kyun is really not shy either. Yes, it's exactly on the back of my hand. Yeom Hye-sun changed her breaking position once more. "Flow High" came out on the side. Kim Hyunkyung

460
00:59:51.580 --> 01:00:00.960
So if you look at this, Kim Yeon-koung clearly has a better eye for the entire court than others. That's how broad Kotivision is. Right.

461
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:13.580
Bukiri is on the straight side and Park Eun-jin is in the center, so we choose the longest course. Yes, I stabbed deep into the fifth spot of your opponent's court. 6 to 104 points

462
01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:21.500
The light cut is clean while sleeping. Mega... I think it's time for Mega to

463
01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:26.080
The viewers can't help but admit it

464
01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.180
Coming to the 4th round of Champ, 7 games

465
01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:37.580
Even though Director Jung has been playing for 13 days now, he hits like this. In fact, we played 7 games in 13 days and pressed 5 sets

466
01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.380
This is a very murderous schedule.

467
01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:42.480
Jung Yoon is shaking after giving and receiving.

468
01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.880
Park Eunjin succeeded in the big dig on the left

469
01:00:50.660 --> 01:01:03.680
Shin Hyun-kyung passes it, but this is a catch ball. It was a catch declaration. Now, after the breaking, the ball kept going back and forth between the two players. Yeah

470
01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.780
Referee Kang Joo-hee declared a catch. That's right. Then, including Suzy Kim

471
01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:14.680
Heungkuk Life Insurance players asked if it was a catch. Right.

472
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.980
You can ask the referee as much as you want.

473
01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:22.180
12

474
01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.000
I'm the director of Time Out Avondaga.

475
01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:43.260
Guys, calm down. It's not good at all. It's too fast

476
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:11.260
Heungkuk Life Insurance suffered an injury during the regular season, but yes

477
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:25.920
In terms of the weight, it might not have been a more critical situation than it is now. Yes, two players from both Boli teams got hit a lot. That's right. 12 to 6 Shin Hyun-kyung at Park Eun-jin's number

478
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.920
It's time to watch Kim Hyunkyu

479
01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:43.580
Anyway, Kim Yeon-koung is at the center of it. Yes, even now, Kim Hyun-kyung's time-based queer pen with a fake fastball, so in the hand of the saltwater center

480
01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:51.460
It doesn't touch at all, and yes, it's Kim Hyun-kyung who is holding the RBI well. That's right. It's Kim Hyun-kyung's Su. 7 to 12

481
01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.740
Yellow

482
01:02:52.840 --> 01:03:00.660
The reception was shaking. Mega turns this ball over in a row. I'll get 5 bounces. Off-spike yellow digs

483
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.500
the left side of the salt

484
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.640
Okay, I went out. line-out perm room

485
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:20.020
First of all, it's a welcome score for Heungkuk Life to score by shaking the serve. That's right. In a way, I think we need this kind of attack the most. That's right. Jeonggwanjang's time out defense is good

486
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:31.700
Just connect it a little more. Just connect it well. You have to soothe those balls well. If you're in front of me, you hit me and hit me again.

487
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:41.880
Yeah, you can't shrink. Just hit me without fear. If you see me like that, I'll add paint. Okay

488
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:49.460
Director Ko Heejin has to talk about the connection

489
01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:53.160
Mega also looks like he's scoring quite well

490
01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:59.660
Bukiris is also in good shape, so if he only comes to the inside

491
01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:03.660
They judge that they have the power to stick with the other brokers now. Right.

492
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:07.460
Actually, we called the players and we couldn't do it today

493
01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:09.660
There are a lot more things that work better than that

494
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.760
The players also kept their spirits alive. Oh, of course. Yes

495
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:18.260
8

496
01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.040
It's Yum, so light bagger Taeye

497
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.140
It's cheating on the grilling player.

498
01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:38.280
In fact, in the third game the day before yesterday, especially when it became a serve situation, there were several mistakes in invading the line. That's right. This is the part. When I scored, I stepped on it and the players got a little cringe

499
01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:46.080
There is, but you have to be careful. That's right. The atmosphere of 9 to 1 is over by 3 points in an instant. If it's Kim Hyunkyung's car, it's simple

500
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.180
It's going to rain. Kim Dae Kyu

501
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.860
In the end, I said it was a battle between serving and receiving

502
01:04:54.040 --> 01:05:00.760
The most welcome serve ace is coming out now. As expected, today's game change is Kim Hyun-kyung.

503
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:13.860
Now, this is the articles of association that begin to cause anxiety little by little. First of all, Heungkuk Life Insurance is properly applying the brakes to Jeong Kwan-jang, who was doing well. Hoyoung is in the middle while sleeping

504
01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:21.060
I told you earlier that Jung Woo Young is showing a lot of performances at the championship

505
01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:35.840
It's not just a score, but in a situation where the atmosphere is sinking, such a score is bound to be quite welcome. With Chung Ho-young's open score, Chung Kwan-jang Redes Parks completed his team course career set success of 2,000 with No. 4.

506
01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.280
Song Yunjoo got yellow from behind

507
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.700
Oh, I'm going back to the salt. Jung Ho-young's banging.

508
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:51.920
It's not that these balls aren't good at defense right now, but Tutuk has to fight back

509
01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:57.620
It's Heungkuk Life Insurance right now that the atmosphere hasn't been continuously rising. What we need here is

510
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.120
It's continuity for Heungkuk. Right, the most important thing is

511
01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.520
Scoring. Yes. 14 to 10

512
01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.300
Good score, Lai

513
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:18.800
Next to the serve ace, it's a serve ace that really raises the atmosphere where the serve ace of the yum-gi could be turned off once again. This is Jeonggwanjang who wants to go to Incheon.

514
01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:34.420
I stabbed Shin Hyeon-kyung exactly in the back. Now, it's a banquet ship where there was a serve ace in Game 3, and we're starting one more time. Let's go again with 15 to 10. Shin Hyun-kyung's bony pipe is long

515
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:44.620
MEGA'S CONNECTION EYE BALL HEARTS TO DOKEY RICH IN FRONT AND LIGHT 1 IS IN THE TWO STEP OPEN SPYZA LINE. Toot 2... Right now

516
01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:59.580
Koo hit the RBI perfectly. It's 11 to 15 now, passing by Jung Ho-young's fingertips, catching an RBI even in a situation that can hardly be caught by blocking. Yes. Great ball control

517
01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:10.280
I'm showing it to you. Now, Jung Ho-young is a fairly high breaking player, but it almost passes upward. Yes, Kim Suzy's defense is 11 to 15

518
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:30.340
Oh, two pitches. This is it. When the yellow player's reception was shaken, how many blocked points did Heungkuk Life make? Now, it is going in that direction. Right.

519
01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:44.300
In the end, I changed Park Tae-min. Heungkuk Life Insurance's Kim Soo-jin and Yeom Hyun-seok came from behind with a 4-3 victory in the blocking fight

520
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:57.700
I'm hitting it. Pocky-ri, it seems like the flow is coming, but in the end, he's not handing over the atmosphere at all with the power of Jeonggwanjang's attack. That's right. The score is 16 to 12 Jeonggwanjang, who leads by four points.

521
01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:01.380
I changed it to Park Hae Min as soon as possible

522
01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:05.460
However, the serve went to Pyo Seung-joo, not Park Hae-min. That's right. First of all

523
01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.960
The direction is... Heungkuk Life Insurance players

524
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.460
I'm trying to move the yellow Bukirich player, but yes

525
01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:18.760
Of course, it's not that I'm not shaking, but it's not a situation where I get a lot of damage from the team. Yes, because of that

526
01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.460
Heungkuk Life Insurance players' attack on this serve

527
01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:28.360
So far, so far, we haven't seen much effect, but we have to see that as well. Peach has calmed down a bit in this set

528
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.060
That's right. I can't see it anymore. Yes

529
01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:33.760
Mega 11 points, Kim Hyun-kyung 12 points,

530
01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:36.360
9 points for Dokiritz, 7 points for two talk

531
01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.860
So far, both teams'

532
01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:44.060
The flow of points to the main and second attack options is similar

533
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.660
Not only Peach but also Kim Soojin

534
01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:50.660
Heungkuk Life should move more actively in the middle.

535
01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:56.560
That's right. If this is the case, it was a battle between serving and receiving

536
01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.060
Now, after hitting the serve, I'm going to do breaking

537
01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:11.600
It could lead to a battle of how much this attack is brought down. Right. I shook up the strong expectation class. This ball was handled with the left and left foot, and behind the chance ball's powerful underland connection

538
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:27.480
It's a touch-out mega. Of course, Heungkuk Life is unable to come up from Heungkuk Life's side and its receiving was not even connected, and the number of chance balls is increasing

539
01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:34.300
Director Jeong's connection is so good right now. In a way, it's the biggest difference between the two teams today in the fightback situation. Right, we're moving on. Timing

540
01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:49.620
The atmosphere of the chairman of the consecutive scoring tennis team also crosses this set a lot. Heungkuk Life Insurance Time Out Out Out Out Out Out Out Out

541
01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:10.180
So each team has their own

542
01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.760
If you don't get good points

543
01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:17.760
The opponent has no choice but to continue to aim for that gap. The first part of volleyball is serve

544
01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.460
If you look at the weight of the serve, Heungkuk Life is much more

545
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:25.260
It looks weak without knowing. The articles of association will continue

546
01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:33.860
As I shake this Shiv while targeting the opponent, there is an atmosphere that seems to be a little sagging without knowing. Kim Hyun-kyung receives it and goes to perspective 1.

547
01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:36.760
I'm the one who did a good job of breaking pitching resources

548
01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.460
Lee Eonwon and Choi Taehoon might go for the ball right now

549
01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:45.160
There was, but it makes a score with paint. Today's match here at the setter

550
01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:47.660
How do you see the centripetal movement?

551
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:50.560
I'm not sure. Is it because the reception is a bit shaky

552
01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:57.960
I don't see much overall play. Right. I opened it with an underhand and turned it over with consecutive strokes. Chanspo Heungkuk Life Insurance Co., Ltd

553
01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.060
Move, move, attack. That's right

554
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:14.000
It was Peach's 3 points in this set. That's right. First of all, the serve receiving is shaking strongly and one more point is added, but in the end, Heungkuk Life's most necessary consecutive points are now out. That's right.

555
01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:25.720
If you can lock up Jeong Kwan-jung with 18 points or 19 points now, Heungkuk Life can keep up. That's right. We're going to Yeom Hye-sun's maxi. The sale is correct.

556
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:38.140
This is a situation in which the players of Heungkuk Life Insurance can't help but be mean to Megal even though we are looking from the top. Yes, that's how perfect it is right now

557
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:51.660
The pitch player completely rolled and moved to catch the mega player. Yes, it creates a river behind the attack line. Even in the third game the day before yesterday, there was no physical change until the first and fifth sets. That's right. This

558
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.840
I heard it. I'm glad for now.

559
01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:08.460
One of the biggest options for Heungkuk Life, which is taking a breather, is that pipe in the middle, and yes, it's blocked the net now, but anyway, breaking has that kind of speed that you can't catch up with. Right.

560
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:16.820
Ttuk's Pipe Attack Scoring Successful 15-19 and game changer Park Soo-hyun came in.

561
01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:27.980
Kim Hyun-kyung returned to No. 4 position in the electric field. Yes, the serve is good. Sub ace, parqui

562
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:42.420
If you do this, you have to cut off the flow. Yes, time out, Jeonggwanjang. It's okay. He's going to drink a bottle of water right away

563
01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:48.980
I told you. YEON KYUNG's two-took is short, but the rest is just hitting hard

564
01:12:49.160 --> 01:13:01.940
Think of it as hitting hard and floating it, and let's hurry up and connect the caba. So we only need to be careful of the people we need to be careful of. There's a net that you can get quickly. We have to watch it together.

565
01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.780
He's going ahead, but director Ko Heejin said, "If the atmosphere goes beyond this

566
01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:13.980
I thought it might be a little hard. Yes, it has to be a game changer

567
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:17.280
Park Suhyun gave this aces

568
01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.280
I stopped the flow once again

569
01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:22.780
On his way to the championship, Park Suhyun made 3 serve aces

570
01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:26.560
That's right. In a way

571
01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:40.960
He's the most powerful player among the one-point servers. It's not easy. Coming to the championship, three sub-base is not easy to say. It's really not easy. I've changed the course of Park Soo-hyun. I shook the receiving and the light is big

572
01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:44.440
This goal is the third best export.

573
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:58.780
If the atmosphere of consecutive scoring spiders is strangely rising toward Heungkuk Life Insurance and Park Soo-hyun's serve is shaken once again, we don't know what the atmosphere will be like now. Right.

574
01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:03.000
That's why the role of Seo Bae-jo is so important. Yes

575
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:16.100
Park Soo Hyun's 3rd serve in a row is good. Life was pulled up from behind the opening because it was yellow. Cho Seong-joo will hit you. Iru

576
01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:29.100
Pyo Seung-soo really makes one point that's not a waste even if he gives 10 points. Of course, director Ko Hee-jin's expression is also talking about that. Right, this

577
01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:43.640
If he went to Heungkuk Life Insurance, Park Soo-hyun would serve one more time, that's right. There was a one-point difference. Yes, but Kim Hyun-kyung is ready to the left of the third Mega by three points. Mega to Kiri Chedi

578
01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.160
I passed it. Shin Hyun-kyung

579
01:14:46.260 --> 01:15:01.220
The two sides are also out of the left pen line. It's a regrettable mistake to attack Kim Hyun-kyung. The first ball... Shin Hyunkyung is facing back too far

580
01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:14.660
The connection was burdensome, and Kim Yeon-kyung's attack angle was burdensome. That's right. 21:17 Ah, it was a very important sunning point a little while ago. Yeah. I did it. This is the spy point

581
01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:30.440
I really try 5 if like Jung Kwang Hwa. Yes, I think Tutu's pipe attack today is more powerful. That's right. And in Game 1, in Game 2, in Game 3, there were actually nine rear-end points. Yeah

582
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:43.160
After the patch came in, Choi Eun-ji came in. 18 to 21

583
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:50.840
You get caught in Choi Hyun-joo's serve-ah-net. If this happens, it's bound to be disappointing.

584
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:55.060
Choi Eun Ji is disappointed

585
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:05.920
Since Jeong Kwan-jang has 3 points left, let's strengthen Ahn Ye-rim's height

586
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:18.240
I'm going to put up a fight once again, and if this happens, Tutck's rear-end attack may be attempted again. That's right. It's Park Jihyun. Let's run on the big left course. It is pulled down to 9 keys in the middle of the yellow pass.

587
01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:29.860
I'm successful. I'm not sure about Panya Keroue. First of all, it was judged to be a little dull now in the attempt to counterattack, but Heungkuk Life's defense line was not reorganized. Yes

588
01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:45.400
Since we're all moving together, there's no maintenance. That's right. That was the cheering director, Ko Hee-jin. Part 2 of the 23:18 Pyo Seungju No.6 is ready for a short time difference. I saved it

589
01:16:45.760 --> 01:17:00.340
Kim Hyun-kyung's time difference scorer is really good. Yes, I can't see you just eating it. Actually, my back is really not in good condition right now. That's right. Kim Hyun-kyung also dug into the gap well.

590
01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:08.640
Pyo Seung-joo gave up his seat in a hurry, but it was a ball that Mega couldn't get. 19:23 Lee Gwon's third

591
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:15.620
Yeom Hye-sun pauses and passes it over. Chanspo Heungkuk Life Insurance's Baek Si-wi will also shut down. Oh, I like it. Too much

592
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.660
Let's make a big attack

593
01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:25.260
If you can hit her like that inside, because Yeom Hye-sun's knee is a bit uncomfortable right now

594
01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:30.360
It's quite difficult to position the defense. That's right. You can see that the movement that's coming out right now is late. Yes

595
01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.200
It's 20 to 233 points

596
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.760
I shook it briefly. Raise your underhand and hit the air tag in a row

597
01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:42.460
Let's open Shin Hyun-kyung's light battle with two blocks

598
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:56.560
There is a special zone. This set is not over yet. Of course, Heungkuk Life can be turned upside down. I'm director Ko Hee-jin asking for a video review. Well, first of all

599
01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:08.560
It's a reading about the in-out. This is a strong will to cut off the flow of prediction once. The articles of association team requested a video review of the in-out. Choi Sung Kwon's assistant referee is also

600
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:17.060
Director Ko Hee-jin said it was an in-out, so I just came here laughing. Anyone watching over here can do it. Yes

601
01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:26.560
But you have to look at the slow screen. I have to watch it. Yes, I closed one eye and it was confirmed as In. So I can see everything even if I close one eye. Of course, right now

602
01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:40.900
As soon as I told Vice Premier Choi Sung-kwon, I called the players right away. This is also a mausoleum of operation. Sure. So what's the flow? twenty one to twenty three

603
01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:47.100
Toki Rich Banquet Line Left Two-Step Off-Spit Nagani For Out. an attack error

604
01:18:47.200 --> 01:19:00.940
I tried to stop the flow once, but in the end, the atmosphere is moving back toward Heungkuk Life, and I didn't see your effect. Heungkuk Life has scored four consecutive points and has now followed under its chin.

605
01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:09.800
Yum Hye-sun Okiritz's Bain after receiving Lee Go-won's Servi Ovind

606
01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.920
Exclusive Blocking

607
01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:28.700
In the end, Heungkuk Life's background will be used. If you make deuce in this set, there is Kim Hyun-kyung on the potential side of Heungkuk Life Insurance, so four defenses have a chance to take this set. That's right.

608
01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:41.780
The second set of Game 3 the day before yesterday was also 36-34. In the prefecture, where the Middle East was big, it was passionate. That's good. Flight mate, life fibre, ta-ma

609
01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.820
The Incredible Turnaround of Korean Life

610
01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:55.940
Once again, I'm doing a video review of Brooking, but I think it's still a lot off.

611
01:19:56.340 --> 01:20:07.040
The articles of association team requested a video review of the block quota out. The mood of the court is completely on Heungkuk Life Insurance's side.

612
01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:25.360
You can see it already Yes, as a result of the reading, it was confirmed as no touch. There are no video readings of this set of articles of association. This is why I can't leave my seat. Of course. Heungkuk Life's strong point

613
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:32.420
It's a really miraculous three points. That's right. It's 24 to 23

614
01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.880
I saved it. And my personality. Oppen to Davy

615
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:50.000
Chas 8 chance to end Heungkuk Life Tracking on the left

616
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.100
This set is

617
01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:05.920
It was in that atmosphere together, but there was Park Eun-jin's right hand. There's a game like this. My right hand is moving a lot.

618
01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:19.540
Kim Hyun-kyung, who couldn't get up for a while. I think it's the first time I've seen a scene where Kim Yeon-kyung is so disappointed this season. Now, Kim Yeon-koung was going to finish it completely. That's right. The game is deuce

619
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.660
The left part here

620
01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:27.460
After slander, Walt Kata was cut off. Promoted

621
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:39.440
The first point, "Where Carver," was very good at concentrating. Yes, in the end, Kim Yeon-koung scores. That's right. Kim Hyun-kyung's eyes are changing again. Yes

622
01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:53.120
In a way, Kim Hyun-kyung's eyes were like this in the fifth set of the second game. That's right. I want Kim Hyun-kyung to show us. Kim Hyun-kyung's serve continues.

623
01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:58.740
Shake it short and back attack mega rebound. Kim Hyunkyung, Park Goeun, and Lee Goeun

624
01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:05.520
Yellow pass again, rear offensive defense.

625
01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:08.540
Run and turn over Kim Soo-ji.

626
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:16.960
This set came from behind to win Heungkuk Life.

627
01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:30.980
The atmosphere that was completely over was Heungkuk Life Insurance's serve ace Park Soo-hyun in the middle. In the end, Heungkuk Life Insurance, which has a strong brewing, takes this set of moods.

628
01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:41.660
Championship Game 3 and today's Game 4 I can't believe it. You're playing an incredible game together. It's Daejeon.

629
01:22:48.540 --> 01:23:03.500
Logain Foam This is the hair loss management so far. Logainform's hair loss management treats hair loss with an itemized hair patented foam type. Beyond scalp care, log-in foam as a target hair item

Heavy morning uncomfortable day constipation tonight with Makin herbal ingredients soft with Western medicine ingredients quick pleasant refreshing exhilarating constipation

631
01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:23.900
Opportunity to meet DB Direct if auto insurance is due.

632
01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:37.020
DB Direct has a special contract for safe driving and discounts up to the number of steps, so if it's due, it's enough to walk for a long time

633
01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:48.880
It's not physical strength. It's fly high. I'll go first this time, too. Clycic K2

634
01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:24.580
Kim Yeon-kyung and Heungkuk Life showed a really crazy performance to the extent that I can't believe they gave up the first set so weakly. That's right. The second set seemed to be over until the second half

635
01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:37.580
Oh, the power of blocking is starting to come out. Yes, Tutck blocked the last scene and eventually took this set, but Tutck scored 10 points in the second set alone. Yes

636
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:48.140
Besides, Tutuk is a player with really good blocking hand shape and timing. That's right. It's very good. If this happens, the atmosphere will be

637
01:24:48.220 --> 01:25:01.000
If Heungkuk Life had moved on to the second set, it would have been the flow of today. Yes, it's balanced now, so if you look at it with concentration, Heungkuk Life

638
01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:12.120
I think they'll focus more. That's how it's shown. When Heungkuk Life, who was following the 2nd set, was four points apart

639
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:25.140
You're going to move on to the articles of association This was the situation. That's right. A lot of fans probably thought so, but there's a lot of atmosphere where one-time volleyball is completely overlooked by something that you can't see. Yes

640
01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:35.060
Heungkuk Life won two more blocks in the second set and three more blocks. That was the only blocking by a two-timer. Yes, only in the second set

641
01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:41.640
It was Tutck who scored 10 points including these three blocks. It's almost like this set was made by Tutteuk.

642
01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.640
Rep. Cha Sang-hyun is

643
01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:49.140
What's in the second set of this championship game? I don't know. Yes, the deuce is still being made

644
01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:51.940
It's that kind of situation. Yes, first of all

645
01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.940
Now, the athletes are

646
01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.540
The balance is right now. Yes

647
01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:02.540
It was definitely a promise for sub-receiving

648
01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:12.340
I predicted that I could make a decision in attack and breaking, but at the end, I caught him with Tutck's breaking. On the other hand, as you can see, this set

649
01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:16.540
The attack rate after 20 points is only in the single digits

650
01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:19.840
71% 44% 28%

651
01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:25.740
It kept falling vertically up to 9%. That's right. The attack that used to be popular

652
01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:30.040
Volleyball is another difficult thing to score like this when you start to get stuck.

653
01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.440
The set score was 1 to 1

654
01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:35.940
I'm going to do this

655
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:41.540
It's a bit big to say that the game is back to square one. That's right. Now

656
01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:46.740
Heungkuk Life is coming back with a chance that you almost lost

657
01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:51.740
It seems that you'll be able to concentrate more. Director Jeong said, "Anyway, these difficult times

658
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:57.440
Didn't you pass a lot and advance to the championship for the first time in 13 years? Yes, let's just take this opportunity

659
01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:04.140
There's a really tight energy between the two teams that shouldn't be handed over. And to coach Ko Hee-jin and Jeong Kwan-jang

660
01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.240
To be honest

661
01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.440
Second round match at Samsan, Incheon

662
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.940
You have to learn from the game. That's right. Of course. So, the lesson is that we're going to end up with Game 3

663
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.840
It was a big driving force in catching them. Yes

664
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.980
Then, today

665
01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:33.640
As you can see, the lineup of both teams remains unchanged as to how the third set will develop in the fourth game. First of all, I don't see much reason to give changes. Yes, in a way, both teams are going porous. By all means.

666
01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.320
Set score 1 to 1

667
01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:45.640
Heungkuk Life Pink Spires Kim Hyun-kyung's serve, who wants to win the trophy here today, are all behind. a mistake on the serve

668
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.960
It's a bit disappointing because it's a strong attack and Kim Yeon-koung's serve.

669
01:27:52.340 --> 01:28:04.240
On the other hand, will Chung Kwan-jang's Fokirich son, who wants to take this series to Incheon This number does not correspond to this number.

670
01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:22.560
Even now, Thai players often throw pitches and taste their hands properly. Yes, I have a good sense of breaking. The timing and the shape of the hands

671
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:33.200
How should I say this? It has the shape of a hand that can bother the other person. Choi Special Zone player has the most blocks in a single individual game, but he already has five today. That's right.

672
01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:38.640
Kim Suzy, are you getting pushed back? Yes, there's a time difference in the middle of the banquet

673
01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:53.600
Jeong Ho-young, I thought Kim Soo-jin's serve was a little delayed, but since he has a tall body, Bookies took overhandle. Yes

674
01:28:53.680 --> 01:29:07.800
It was the first attack mistake of Jung Ho-young, who felt sorry for Jung Ho-young, 2 to 1 point difference between Kim Soo-ji and Jung Ho-young, who served consecutively. Short five runs and a RBI single behind the South Line. Long

675
01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:20.860
It's going to hit and fall. More touches have already been made before that. That's right, but Kim Yeon-koung looks at the ball and pursues it until the end. Yes. Heungkuk Life, the fault of Touch

676
01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.460
I made surfing. Yes

677
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:38.360
I touched the net on my way down. Jung Ho-young, who tied the score of 2 with an underhand, is ready for success. After BB, do I connect and out hacker directly move on?

678
01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:57.820
Jung Yoon-joo is not sure about direct key. If the timing wasn't right, I could have made it a chance ball again, but I was in a hurry.

679
01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:02.920
After the rebound, you drill with one stroke. That's right.

680
01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:10.300
Mega Jung Woo-hyuk's sub-body is bent to receive it. We're going to Maxey. Waterweed

681
01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:24.560
Now, Cho Deuk-gu even sets the offensive tempo after a few breaking have been caught. Yes, Lee Goeun will move quickly and put the backpass blocker on top of the backpass blocker

682
01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:37.900
The service of the Tutuk super-special zone shows accurate control and is refracted by one stroke. Yum Hye-sun is low

683
01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:54.600
Now, Jung Pyo-sung was falling while receiving serve reception, so there was no option to attack on the left. Yes, you lose it accurately and the pitch player puts in the salt accurately. That's right.

684
01:30:54.680 --> 01:31:04.740
Peach's Blocking 4-3 Cotco No. 6 goes to Bukirich Maxill. a hard-hitting player

685
01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.340
And to the left, JUNG YOON JU

686
01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:21.360
It's a decision. Yes, it's the fault of the touch. We just saw the flow of the ball from the top, and we saw Choi Sung-kwon's respect for the net shook accurately. That's right.

687
01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:35.240
He's touching it as he's coming down. While the reserve ball is already floating, Jung Yoon-joo's touch net error is 4 to 4 tie No. 5

688
01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:43.360
It goes to the pipe, not the movement attack. That's right. Oh, I saved it. It's a loss before you know it. Let's move on. We have a rally to believe in. Yeah

689
01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:47.040
Request a video review of the mid-rally.

690
01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:59.920
The Heungkuk Life Team has requested a video review of the defensive success failure. I'm the director of Abondaji who wants to see if it's a flow touch or not.

691
01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:16.900
Right here

692
01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:30.620
When Bukirich makes pancakes, two players stretch out together and this happens again? I've never seen a pancake like this before. I'm not sure

693
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:44.400
I've seen almost one-handed, but I don't think I've seen the four players stretch out together toward the ball, but there seems to be no gap in the middle. Senior has been identified as a defensive success. That's right.

694
01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:55.220
This is a synchronized pancake. I think I've never seen something like this before. Me too, I was baking one pancake and there were two frying pans in it. This is really

695
01:32:55.300 --> 01:33:06.980
Coincidentally, there are so many things to see before the championship. That's right. The 5-to-4 score is a 1-point gap between Mega and Lee Dong-guk.

696
01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:22.720
Even if it's strong, it's not just strong, it's really strong. That's right. It has a high RBI rate.

697
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:26.220
5

698
01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:44.180
Yeah, you have to be careful Player of the year, you shouldn't have any more pain. That's right. Kim Hyun-kyung, you can't miss this because of the direct kill score. Yes

699
01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:53.600
6

700
01:33:54.420 --> 01:34:08.820
Since there is a soft spot center in front of the continuous scorer, he catches an RBI and scores lightly. Yes, Jung Yoo-jin's spinning serve eventually creates a score. Yellow player is getting ready

701
01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:19.400
I've been side skiing a lot. That's right. Jung Yoon-joo is getting hooked a little longer this time. The line on the left side of the 3rd line

702
01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:33.180
Park Eun-jin will put this up and go short in Yeonhwa. Park Eun-jin's rebound play back attack is over the limit.

703
01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:37.320
Shin Eun-kyung's Two Star Open Paint Hig

704
01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.360
Park Eun-ji turned to a straight line.

705
01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:57.160
Three players got tangled up together. First of all, 2P-gyu caught the ball while falling, so Jung Yoon-joo and Shin Hyun-kyung missed the call sign. Yes

706
01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:10.020
Of course, the ball was on top of the body again. Pitchers Shin Hyun-kyung and Jung Yoon-joo are tangled in one place right now. That's right. The score of 6 to 7 is a one-point difference. Swabi

707
01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:15.640
Take it underhand. The time difference is on the left

708
01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:27.640
If you go up like this, it's almost 100 points with white hair. That's right. The score is 8 to 6 Heungkuk Life Insurance leads by 2 points. It's Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon.

709
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.940
Compass of Korea's Health

710
01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.200
Korea's First Stomach Health Double Formulation Will Peony

711
01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.200
I'm going to take care of my stomach's health

712
01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:46.760
As expected, it's an outpatient on the top. If you're curious about MG Saemaul Geumgo insurance

713
01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:58.940
Meet anywhere in our land, from big cities to small towns. MG will be with you wherever you need insurance. MG Saemaul Geumgo Insurance to Customers

714
01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:13.940
The score is 8 to 6 Heungkuk Life Insurance leads by 2 points. Heungkuk Life Insurance won an incredible victory in the second set

715
01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:25.000
I was so shaken, and now I think I'm back with a Heungkuk Life-like performance. Right, the scariest player is Kim Yeonkyung. Yes, we did the 2nd set

716
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:40.040
At the end, he said that Kim Hyun-kyung's eyes are changing, but that's right. Kim Hyun-kyung's eyes have completely changed. Yes, at the end of the previous set, Kim Hyunkyung's facial expression was

717
01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:54.420
In the fifth set of the second game, Lee Go-eun, post everything to me from now on. That's right. It was the same expression. He's saying he'll take responsibility for it. That's right. A player with 8 to 6 is a 2-point difference

718
01:36:54.500 --> 01:37:07.280
I handed it all over with my fist, and I can't hit it with my hands behind me. Booky paint drips to the left from Chansco vasculitis. Both teams

719
01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:11.760
I got one chance each time, but both teams couldn't connect. All right.

720
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:21.320
It's Kerch, who's putting the exquisite paint on it, so this can turn the mood around. Yes

721
01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:28.020
I really can't predict until it's over. That's right. Park Eunji is on the sod

722
01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:34.720
Jeong Hyeonju, left of the mouth

723
01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:42.140
You have to do it and pass it over. Take it as an obindra and bake-out time mecca in Yum

724
01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:57.520
The connection is not working well all of a sudden. Yes, there was a powerful rear-end attack of mega. It looks like both teams need to calm down a little more.

725
01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:09.280
You have to be a little more calm. That's right. Jeong Kwan-jang, who almost won the game, lost the set, and Heungkuk Life Insurance caught the set that was all. That's right. It's shaking. Heungkuk Life, which is shaking now, has risen.

726
01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:24.000
I do. Kim Hyun-kyung This is really the dedication of Lee Kun-ho. I moved almost 5m and 6m and curled the under eye really well. Yes, it was really a pass to throw your body.

727
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:36.640
Kim Hyun-kyung has to repay this right away. Right, Kim Hyunkyung who roars out loud is 9 to 8 points

728
01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:50.040
Take it by hand number 5 and go behind the banquet line. I got Life Live. I caught it. The left side cloth goes to Kim Hyun-kyung's team. Kim Su-ji's regular pass height was low. That's right. It's JUNG HOYOUNG

729
01:38:50.120 --> 01:39:04.120
I uploaded it, but it was a bit rough. Let's go with figures. He was a pitching player who couldn't swing accurately in the end with a low cookie-rich ball, and because he had a heart, he was a Kokki-rich player with a ball attached to him

730
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:19.020
The one that got stabbed was actually scored more. So throughout this series, director Ko Hee-jin told Bulkich to deal with it quickly only from the top. I'm talking about this. It's the most effective. Yes, Yeom Hye-sun's defense vs. ball tie

731
01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:23.620
Jung Yoon-jun, Rishi-gu Jungwon is better. Good. Blocking

732
01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:25.620
a reverse shot

733
01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:35.000
If Choi Tae-ho can't attack because it's not connected, so now we have no choice but to choose Kim Yeon-koung on the left.

734
01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:44.180
If Mega and Jung Woo-hyun notice and move in the front, Kim Yeon-koung can also feel burdened. That's right. It's a successful articles of association.

735
01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:52.800
Yeom Hye-sun and Jung Yoon-joo are shaking. You have to roll Kim Hyun-kyung. Yes, Kim Hyunkyung, who hits your left side at Ewha Womans University

736
01:39:53.440 --> 01:40:08.320
Upload from outside the end line. It is judged that this ball bouquirich was not hit and was out. First of all, the defense was connected and the connection was good, but it is clear from Pukirich's side. Request a video review of the block touch.

737
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:16.700
Joo Deuk-guk once signed it from the Manjang team that it was not right at all. I requested a video review of the Blockco touchout.

738
01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.660
Let's take a look.

739
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:32.040
On the straight side, the two-took angle seems far away. It has been confirmed as an oh-touch.

740
01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:40.700
Director Jung has one video review left in three sets.

741
01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:53.860
The gap between the two teams is neither narrowing nor widening, as if it will open 10 to 10 more. That's why I'm in the fog. Yes, Kim Hyunkyung's serve

742
01:40:54.360 --> 01:41:00.420
The direction of the hukiruchi paint has changed from the piker to the back.

743
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:15.160
The pitchman was hit by the hand while coming in and broke it again. That's right. The ball was higher than I thought, so I targeted the paint. Yes, I read the players who are breaking up and the pitching players who are defending, but at the end, I changed my direction. Yes

744
01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.860
It bends against Kim Soo-jae's hand. Good. Shin Hyunkyung

745
01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.160
a ticket holder

746
01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:35.980
I've already judged that there's an intensity since I passed the serve. Yes, I watch the video about Aha Overnet. That's right. Director Avon Danza requesting a video review of Overnet. Byrne

747
01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:47.400
It's a touch net. Touch Dongkuk Life Team requested a video review of four Touch Net touches. It's a touch net. At first, the signal came out as overnet, but I want to see the touchnet.

748
01:41:48.180 --> 01:42:00.100
When Pyo Seung-joo handled it directly at this time, it was confirmed that it was not four touches at all.

749
01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:13.000
I've already seen the net shake a little bit before that. Yes, I think the word "two teams are tight" is definitely correct. That's right.

750
01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:19.880
Now there is no video review of Heungkuk Life in the third set. Let's rent a car to the left for two minutes.

751
01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:32.000
The offense's fault, Jung Yoon-joo, and Abonja, need to cut off the timing now. Time out. Oh, I like the pliers here

752
01:42:32.820 --> 01:42:35.900
It's not swimming.

753
01:42:48.420 --> 01:43:02.040
There are people who can't hear Amondaza's voice

754
01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:15.860
I called Lee Go-eun separately. Yes. I called it separately and it took almost 1 to 11 operation time. That's right. The score is 13 to 18, which is manager Avon Danja. It's going to be about allocation, after all. Yeah

755
01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:24.680
This is why the setter is difficult. That's right. It's a 3-point difference, and it goes right in. I got it.

756
01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:39.340
There was such a timing for carrier Heungkuk Life's point player direct kill, and there was also a timing for Yeom Hye-sun to receive the center when it came over, but this was another two-point difference.

757
01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:51.940
This is a loss that Director Jung should not give. Of course not. Lucky Score Heungkuk Life. 11 to 13 points is Kim Soojin by 2 points

758
01:43:52.800 --> 01:44:03.740
I get it as O-Bind and open it and go to Maxi. Mega Blue Car Anyway, the flow almost went over again, but one Mega player had a good side-out. Yes

759
01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:13.640
Tu Deuk-gu tried to catch it by changing the breaking position, but Mega's attack was strong. That's right. 14 to 11. If I couldn't turn it around here

760
01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:19.360
Director Jeong's mood almost completely sagged. That's right. The damage of this set is intact. Yes

761
01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:29.260
From the previous set, Shin Eun-ji seems to have completely relieved this burden. Strong defensive tie-ticking didn't make a point. a reasonable person

762
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.180
This is a bit

763
01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:45.260
Is it a matter of flow or concentration? Well, it's the second time the articles of association, including the number of runs that you can't give out a little while ago. That's right.

764
01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:57.300
Hey, if you come back, this could be a really painful situation. Right, it's 12 to 14 in Tutu. So, the game is weird

765
01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:08.080
You might think that Heungkuk Life might catch it if you concentrate a little, but yes, this is more burdensome for Heungkuk Life. Right. Of course, there's a mistake on the serve at this time. That's right.

766
01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:17.420
I watched it while lowering my head. 2 High School's left side Jung Yoon-ju Blocking Tader Battle

767
01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:30.800
Light by Cotech. I'm the one. This goes to the pipe, not the moving attack. Shall we go again? Light by Cotech will be taken. I'm going to ride the floating cover.

768
01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.440
Yellow

769
01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:34.360
Mega Pass

770
01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.380
It's been short.

771
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.620
It's a bit twisted.

772
01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:41.300
Jeong Yunjoo's straight line

773
01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:42.380
Lime

774
01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:53.620
One of the referee's video review requests was out, and in the end, referee Kang Joo-hee makes a self-read.

775
01:45:53.800 --> 01:46:05.540
We have to. The referee has requested a video review of the in-out. The referee's judgment was a little bit as difficult as the performance of both teams. It's important. Yes

776
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:12.000
Look. This barley

777
01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:23.080
It falls here. They came in. Yes, as a result of the supervision, it has been confirmed as In. I have to admit this Of course, it was a scoreless course. That's right.

778
01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:32.300
Wouldn't it be the most perfect course for a striker? If you can hit something, you have to hit everything over there.

779
01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:43.440
13

780
01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.200
I'll ride the yellow Lissy garden light back girl

781
01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:57.660
I'll score. She turned Park Soo-yeon's serve at once. And Park Suhyun's defense went to the right direction

782
01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:05.000
Without control, the articles of association come up with a side-out at once. The articles of association are leading by three points. It's Daejeon.

783
01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:12.460
We say this when our minds and steps are light. Lalala Light Step

784
01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:17.700
Light with overwhelming lightness

785
01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:22.060
3

786
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:37.040
Welcome to the spring of Nordisk High Nordisk

787
01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:46.600
We are with commentator Cha Sang-hyun at Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon.

788
01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:49.280
I think this series is really good for every game

789
01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:51.580
in the midst of a heated game

790
01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:54.280
I think today's Game 4 is

791
01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.680
I think it'll be at its peak. That's right. If you look at the flow of the game

792
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:06.580
I can't take my eyes off the feast. Yes, the articles of association have overcome one crisis. That's right. 16 to 13 Park Suhyun

793
01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:11.880
Lee's left spear pen's flag bearer's dig yellow.

794
01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:14.160
I hesitated and turned it over. 3

795
01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:21.240
I handed it over with my fist and caught it. I'm the receiver. What's this ball on the left? Move on

796
01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:22.480
I don't.

797
01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:32.880
I don't know. I just touched the ball right next to referee Kang Joo-hee. I'm sure it's a matter of physical strength for both teams

798
01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:46.780
Or it might be a matter of flow, but the connection is a little unstable right now. If you did this much, there would be a physical burden. Of course, I can't say there isn't, but it goes up strangely. Switch

799
01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:56.220
When I was able to catch the good timing, there was a difference that it was a mistake after the two-two. So it's the same situation

800
01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:11.200
Korea Life Insurance continues to be given opportunities, but it's making mistakes on its serve, right? Jeong Kwan-jang is not taking the opportunity to run away due to his own mistakes. Soon, the performance of both teams in the three sets is actually not good. That's right. Yes, bone piper tae

801
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:24.380
Fluke out pitching is fast. The rebound was good, but he couldn't catch the defense. 15/17 Lee Donghoon who makes perfect setting play. Yes

802
01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:28.280
Jung Ho-young's right hand was right and he was out.

803
01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.640
the services of a science and engineering school

804
01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:51.140
The serve ace, if this serve that's been done so far, I wouldn't have been able to set the tone. That's right. Time out, Jeonggwanjang

805
01:49:51.220 --> 01:50:05.300
Now, listen to me first in the game. I mean, there's a flow of games. They're here now. We're here too

806
01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:19.820
Don't scream. In this case, if we want to make the mood as loose as possible, don't share it. Slowly, one by one

807
01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:24.200
It's the first time I've heard about director Ko Hee-jin's story during the operation time.

808
01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:26.400
First, the atmosphere

809
01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:30.600
The coaches of both teams must know. There are many opportunities coming

810
01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:36.300
Because I couldn't take advantage of that opportunity, coach High School now talked about this kind of operation. Yes, in the end

811
01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:40.100
Just because you want to go quickly doesn't mean you can just go with two or three points.

812
01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:46.520
Do you mean that the other person doesn't want to fight with you just because you're fighting? That's right. 16 to 171 points

813
01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:56.620
I was defended by Yeom Hye-sun's light biker. I moved on. I passed it. Park Jaehyun will receive it and go to the left course of this song. Kim Hyun-kyung

814
01:50:58.340 --> 01:51:09.900
I got hit by the equalizer breaking and came into the court, too. I should have scored quickly when the direct came over, but Jeong Kwan-jang's players are hesitating now. Yes

815
01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:23.520
Now, Kim Hyun-kyung penetrates the gap accurately. 17 to 17 Tie Heungkuk Life Insurance's Choi Seung-joo trying to revive the memory of this set

816
01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:30.300
I thought there would be a stonemason in front of me

817
01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:45.340
Jeong Kwan-jang, who cut the flow once and was leading by 2 points and 3 points, is now only one point apart. That's right. If you turn the side-out, it's tied again. Yes, 18 to 17 Yeom Hye-sun

818
01:51:45.420 --> 01:51:49.760
There is a score for sub 1 today. I like Kim Seok-kwon. Kim

819
01:51:50.260 --> 01:52:01.300
This is Kim Soo-jin, who makes the first attack score in this difficult situation. Based on my career postseason game, it's my 52nd game

820
01:52:01.380 --> 01:52:07.120
It's the best record ever, and the first score came out now. This was my first attempt. Yes

821
01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:23.320
So this is a pretty good signal for Heungkuk Life. That's right. Park Suhyun fell into a bright smile. He's done his part. Take it from the front and Doki's t-shirt behind Yang Hyun Suk

822
01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:35.780
It's touch out. Now, the player extended one hand well while moving, but if this seems to work, it floats inside the court and even connects. Yes, you can't hold it

823
01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:38.860
So I went towards the antenna where there was a camera. Right

824
01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:50.920
Oh, it stretched out well. It was Lee Go-eun who did her best until the end. Bukirich's sub Shin Hyun-kyung, the opponent's guard touch out Kim Hyun-kyung sitting behind Yvonne

825
01:52:51.000 --> 01:53:03.080
The number of pipes in the middle is Lee Go-hoon, who continues to increase his share in this situation. Yes, since this is a score, I keep trying. Right.

826
01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:10.280
Kim Hyun-kyung's pipe option 2 is taking advantage of the pipe attack option of the special zone. a tie of 19 to 19

827
01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:14.420
Kim Suzy

828
01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.820
Yellow

829
01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:29.600
We're going to Yeom Hye-sun's Baek-si. Mega is bound. Kim Hyun-kyung's underhand pass light zone was received by open spike Yeom Hye-sun. Or we got Macca Luke again

830
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:41.100
Heungkuk Life's breaking power comes back in an important situation. Time Out Chairman Chung Gu

831
01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:56.660
You've been connecting me for months now. Why aren't you trying to connect me? Why aren't you trying

832
01:53:56.740 --> 01:54:03.180
There's no problem if we do well and the game goes on, but we keep doing weird things

833
01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:09.140
Why are you so distracted? Focus

834
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:13.020
Don't miss the ball

835
01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:27.340
From the standpoint of what I'm doing, I'm not trying to avoid it. Yes, each player has an element of anxiety, and it's a situation where when and how fast they shake it. Right.

836
01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:38.740
As the connection continues to fall, it is certainly true that the players have increased their subprasiri. In a way, coach Ko Hee-jin pushed the players the loudest for the first time in today's game. That's right.

837
01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:42.160
20

838
01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:46.540
Heungkuk Life Insurance's Kim Soo-ji's line to turn the tables

839
01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.960
Pyo Seung Ju and Yeom Hye Sun

840
01:54:51.660 --> 01:55:01.740
Heungkuk Life Insurance has scored consecutive points. Now, the players on the court need some maintenance. Yes

841
01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:10.480
If you hand over the atmosphere by mistake, there will be no more opportunities. Actually, when you go with this flow, there's nothing for director Jeong to do. Right.

842
01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:18.320
I ordered it suddenly. Take it underhand, put it back, and lose

843
01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:28.620
Kim Hyun-kyung saved it, and Lee Go-eun jumps. And we're going to play two soccer games. You have to dig it out of the salt again

844
01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:43.760
There were stonemasons and Jung Hwa-young now, but the pitch player only saw the mega player, but he couldn't catch it. Yes, Kim Hyung-kyun's defensive concentration is good. That's right.

845
01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:55.160
And Mega 20-21 Lee Sun-woo, who hits this, just came in, and he decided that he needed a shot at Ye. Right, Hoyoung

846
01:55:55.240 --> 01:56:05.940
Kim Hyun-kyung receives it and goes to 100 o'clock. I'm ready to throw. Mega's pass, Lee Sunwoo. It's me on the left. Lee Sunwoo, Shin Hyunkyung, dg, and left Jung Yoonjoo

847
01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:22.480
The tie-breaking blocker is now the two fights between the two teams, attack or breaking. There's really a game like this. You can't catch the flow like this.

848
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:28.260
It's the performance of both teams that doesn't seem to fall over. Mega's tie blocking

849
01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:32.640
Kim Hyun-kyung is going a little back. And a big blow

850
01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:43.340
A Dutk player who puts one-broke and completely pierce it now. The 22 to 21 player goes back in.

851
01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:57.240
1

852
01:57:06.620 --> 01:57:20.700
Coach Amonanza, who is ranked first in this match, has to fight back when Pyo Seung-min attacks somehow. Shin Hyunkyung took a good look. Yes

853
01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:25.200
You've fallen into a position where you can't turn it over. Tu Yeon-kyung, who was guarding the rear

854
01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:31.480
Open One Tynd and Jung Kyu Hyun's show Open Spy is good.

855
01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:47.260
Now, since Yeom Hye-sun has some pain in her knee, Park Eun-jin opened one-blocking. Yes, it creates a touch-out by rotating it again. And it was Yeom Hye-sun who fell behind Park Eun-jin. That's right.

856
01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:53.620
23

857
01:57:53.780 --> 01:57:59.740
You can get the most out of your way. I did the bagger track because it's light It's coming from my hand

858
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:06.900
Coach Shin Hyun-kyung and Kim Hyun-kyung saved both hands. Park Eunjin opened the pass paint

859
01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:22.040
Even in this urgent situation, the Yeomhaeop Center can put pass painting. It's really Kang Xinjiang. Wow, I tricked everyone. So

860
01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:36.720
Oh, Shin Hyun-kyung was noticing that she was having a hard time and couldn't get a seat. That's right. Yeom Hye-sun, who asked for a calmer play, is going to tag a lot. the third baseman of the crown prince

861
01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:38.840
And Pyo Seung Joo is second.

862
01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:50.520
Heungkuk Life Insurance's 3 points It's a pipe attack with every important point exploding. Wow, players from both teams are

863
01:58:51.300 --> 01:59:04.780
It's exerting superhuman abilities. That's right. Lim Hyerim is here. Can Choi Hyun-ji be the last sub right now? Lim Hyerim for exclusive use

864
01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:11.540
The serve is Choi Eun Ji and Heungkuk Life Insurance's 3 sets of 3 points

865
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.120
I shook the yellow one. In the night, the spy is open with 2 left letters

866
01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:31.580
Following the out set, the three sets also go deuce. First of all, Lee Myung-hee was changed by Lee Kyung-hoon, and he got the height right, but in the end, Ubiquirich penetrates it with his power. Yes

867
01:59:31.660 --> 01:59:41.200
Lee Hyerim is out. Since Kim Yeon-kyung is on the left right now, there is a possibility that Bukirich will come this way.

868
01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:54.780
Time out is breaking. I think this will be the highlight of today's victory. That's how it works.

869
02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:26.020
So, if Yeom Hye-sun's center is in its current position, he may target Kim Soo-jin and poke the paint briefly. Yes, if you can't receive it

870
02:00:26.100 --> 02:00:36.880
It's a situation where you have to break through the breaking of Kim Yeon-koung and Boogie Richie Jung Ho-hyun with your power. Yes, 24 to 24. It's Jung Soo-jin's serve, which is very important.

871
02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:42.940
Jeong Suji came in. Give and receive each other in a low position. Kim Hyun-kyung

872
02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:44.280
I caught it.

873
02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:50.280
Auburn's home room. Auburn's home room

874
02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:57.780
I'm director Ko Hee-jin asking for a video review.

875
02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:05.580
The articles of association team requested a video review of Obanet.

876
02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:10.980
The initial decision was overnet. You have to see the moment when it's heating up.

877
02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:24.560
It's actually okay to get heated and go over your hand. Yes, how about watching it from here? This is Court Boli's hand

878
02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:40.100
After being hit by the hand, it doesn't matter that the hand goes over to Heungkuk Life Insurance. Yes, we have to look at the point of the neck-and-neck race. The player's right hand

879
02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:54.840
When the ball was touched for the first time, the reading confirmed it was over-net. Yes, the initial decision will continue as it is. I did. Yes, this is a situation that we have to accept, right? There is no video review of the third set of articles of association.

880
02:01:54.920 --> 02:02:01.440
Both teams now have only the referee's video review alive, with no video review. That's right. Yes

881
02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:05.520
Heungkuk Life's Cell Point 255 vs. 254

882
02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:16.600
Lee Gu, Seung-jun, Yeom In-seok, Jung Woo-hyun. In this situation, Jung Ho-hyun's time difference comes out.

883
02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:30.360
Wow, you have a strong heart. Yeom Hye-sun has a strong heart, and Jung Ho-young has a strong heart. I used Jung Ho-young, who could have contracted, once more. It's the best seat. from the perspective of the articles of association

884
02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.980
25 to 25

885
02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.780
The pen on the left here

886
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:36.580
Kim Hyeon-jung

887
02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:50.420
This is why Kim Hyun-kyung is called Kim Hyun-kyung. Yes. You know how to break, but you chase after it, but you make it the longest course, regardless of whatsoever. Now, he's the first to score 1,000 points in the postseason

888
02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:59.740
It's Kim Hyun-kyung. Now, you even made a really good record of yourself, and it's amazing. the harvest of Kim Hyun-kyung

889
02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:10.120
After making a thousand points for the deuce postseason again, it's a mistake, so it's a shame. Yes

890
02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:22.420
Twenty-six vs. Twenty-six Amodaza: I'm sweating. Deuce wins are similar to both teams. No. 5 is short, and left is Jung Yong Jun. That's right

891
02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:37.920
If the flow has passed, we can't help but talk about breaking. At some point, we change the atmosphere with breaking. Yes, let's check out Hoyoung's exact timing

892
02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:52.120
There's a lot of left hand coming in. Is it three millennia of Jeong Ho-young's Jeonggwanjang, who is heavily surrounded? Oh, the serve went in for a long time. Curl to the left, pull it down, and grab it. Jung Yunjoo, the brokers of the articles of association

893
02:03:52.200 --> 02:04:04.340
Mega moved his position because he thought he would choose to throw. Yes, it's Lee Kun-hoon who was reading it correctly. Choi Hyun-ji is out and Peach is back. It's a tie again.

894
02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:19.240
Kim Soo-ji's serve is also important for the 27th to 27th serve. Once again, Lee Seung-gi came to the second defense. the water front of the seat table

895
02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:27.480
Heungkuk Life's Kim Suzy's serve timing is really fun, but if you do that, the standard player

896
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:35.000
Rather than handing it over, it's a situation where you have to float it and have a fight with breaking. Right.

897
02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:42.960
Kim Soo-ji, a Heungkuk Life Cell, Scores of Tutuko Covering in an avant-garde position

898
02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:46.700
That's right. It's not on the left, but it's going into the fall.

899
02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:56.000
Out Information Jung Ho-young and Yeom Hyun-sun use the time difference in a surprise move. Yes, right now

900
02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:08.460
The time difference works with Jung Ho-young in the second half of the third set. Tu Deuk-gu was moving to go to the three-groove game, but he got caught in a dynamic game. a tie of 28 to 28

901
02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:23.520
I caught Young's short defense match to match. We have a chance to turn the tables. I caught a hundred guns, a rookie, a rich man. Jung Eun-joo will upload it. It's Jans Ball. From the back

902
02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:25.880
Mega connection. The ball

903
02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:28.420
I'm going to hit you. Mr. Cha went in

904
02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:33.260
Behind Ha Hyunjin, a one-on-one fact mask

905
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:34.700
It's out.

906
02:05:34.940 --> 02:05:48.920
Pyo Seung-joo's judgment was good. I was thinking about whether we could score or not, but both teams are sweating. How nervous can we be? No, I'm doing it next to the broadcast right now

907
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.680
Commissioner Cha Sang-hyun's forearms are all sweaty. That's right. Yes

908
02:05:53.020 --> 02:05:59.200
29 to 28 points are at a loss. Director Jeong's three points

909
02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.020
the inside

910
02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:18.680
I'm going to take this really picturesque back-to-back from Jagoeun. you would have thought that it was a good opportunity. Yes

911
02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:21.920
A tutu player makes another score, right? That's right.

912
02:06:22.380 --> 02:06:24.860
the service of two to four

913
02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:43.320
As Floki's reception went overboard a little, I thought it would go to a fastball, but the pitch player is quick to notice. Yes, director Ko Yujin is disappointed

914
02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:55.860
So when the ball sticks, Park Eunjin needs to take care of it faster That's what I'm talking about. That's right. 30:29 Two-took serve is good. I shook it briefly. He didn't become Risp. Pyo Seung-joo

915
02:06:57.320 --> 02:07:11.940
Wow, Pyo Seung-joo made it. I can't help but admire it. Yes, 30s and 30s are really lucky. This player

916
02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:20.840
Are you the one who came as a reward player? I think so. Number one, number two. Move back. Attack

917
02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:23.300
Peach's mistake

918
02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:27.380
Well, first of all, it's because there's no video review.

919
02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:42.300
Well, once again... How should I say this? It's a disappointing part. As I said, I used all three sets for both teams. That's right. Even if you want to write a video review, there's no more. That's right.

920
02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:55.620
I'm going to take advantage of it and go with Jeong Hyeonju Jung Yoon-joo, yes, you're wrong. Okay, I'm taking it. I'm the winner. Kim Hyun-kyung and Ji Hyun-joo are going to go. Jung Yunjoo's paint connection

921
02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:13.480
The location of the moving attack is up. The bookie location is all three bookies. It's a three-set game that doesn't end as if the offense is going to end. Both teams had chances in the middle

922
02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:26.480
So this eventually became a Tooth from a mistake. Coach Ko Hee-jin must have expected it to end now, but how far are you going?

923
02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:33.440
Jung Yoon-gyu's service fee is short. Let's pick Yum Minseop's bag

924
02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:48.060
Now, the burden of the attack is broken again to show your position accurately. That's right. Cache Blocking

925
02:08:48.140 --> 02:08:59.260
The pitchman who won eight blocks in the third game, but now you have to be careful about the rotation serve rather than the strong ball. Heungkuk Life Insurance's three points Jung Yoon-joo's defense

926
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:12.800
You have to do a self-review But Peach's expression wasn't very good.

927
02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:17.960
The referee has requested a video review of the blockcotter chow.

928
02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:27.240
If this didn't fit, I would have stepped down. It's strange.

929
02:09:28.980 --> 02:09:35.140
That's the most nerve-wracking reading of today's game. That's right.

930
02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:41.700
Oh, yes, it was confirmed as Kim Hyun-kyung's right touchout. a four-megapixel score

931
02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:57.060
Have you ever watched a game like this, Senator Cha Sang-hyun? Oh, I think I won while watching the broadcast on the spot. It's so much fun. I don't think there's ever been such a championship in the men's and women's divisions.

932
02:09:57.140 --> 02:09:59.560
a sub-missive ticket winner

933
02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:14.200
30

934
02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:28.880
Peach Dawn's serve is important. Yes, today's 10th patch, including 5 points for blocking

935
02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:30.140
Yellow

936
02:10:33.940 --> 02:10:35.720
Are you going up to finish?

937
02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:41.360
I can't hit you. Jasball Jungtae's round is out again

938
02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:45.300
It's like this again. Yes

939
02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:59.120
So it was good to change the breaking position, but the players behind you should even know where the striker above you is. That's right. Director Ko Heejin and Mega's high-five

940
02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:04.580
33

941
02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:25.780
Pull out the sub X. In the end, it's pressure. We are all sweating right now, but Jung Yoon has to overcome this receiving. Here we go again.

942
02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:33.420
If director Jung's point doesn't work, Shin Eun-kyung should cover it quickly. It's lagging. Line-out mistakes

943
02:11:34.220 --> 02:11:48.840
I think the third set won't end. Now, I've secured the tie for the most points scored in the first set of the championship game. That's right. Yes, first of all, right now

944
02:11:48.920 --> 02:12:03.140
Heungkuk Life Insurance has the highest breaking height because Lee Kun-hoon fell into the rear, but that's right. It's beyond receiving. Here's the chance, Kim Hyun-kyung. Kim Hyun-kyung, non-regular banquet hall left

945
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:05.520
That's right.

946
02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:18.540
It's Heungkuk Life Insurance, which can't take advantage of a single opportunity. The winner of the second set of the 3rd game was 36 vs. 334

947
02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:33.060
It was Heungkuk Life. Yeah. Now, if there is a Yeom Hye-sun center on the avant-garde side and now goes to the rear side, rather, the highest braking was made by the leader Jeong. Yeom Hye-sun's class drops by three points in the articles of association.

948
02:12:36.420 --> 02:12:43.480
Jung Yu-ji's receiving was shaken and he got hit by Denise

949
02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:53.640
Yeom Hye-sun setter got it right again. Jeong Kwan-jang, who suffered a perfect reverse defeat in the second round of the championship game

950
02:12:53.720 --> 02:13:08.500
It was paid back, and the game in Game 3 was the same score as the set of 36-34 defeat. This is Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon.

951
02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:45.720
Why do you think a Dodram is the first place? Experts who keep the freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. The first place to make a Dodram. The taste that I like. A Dodram

952
02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:54.340
It's a perfect age to see the second child in an era of prolonged youth. It's the perfect age to get a new job.

953
02:13:54.460 --> 02:14:01.000
Insurance plays a longer role for your longer youth. Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd

954
02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:17.180
Since the day before yesterday, commentator Cha Sang-hyun and I have been broadcasting as if we don't have any vocal cords left. Yes, I say it's like that, but it's like that. Yes

955
02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:31.640
Well, I'm a volleyball player and I'm commentating now, but I'd like to express my gratitude to the players of both teams for showing such a great performance at the championship

956
02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:44.240
That's the kind of situation I want to do. That's right. You saw three sets of short stories before another all-time championship game. The final score is the same as the 2nd set of the 3rd game

957
02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:56.140
36

958
02:14:56.220 --> 02:15:06.960
How much pressure do the players overcome this pressure? Jung Yoon-soo eventually gave two receptions, and the set went over, but yes

959
02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:20.000
Heungkuk Life has a chance of winning when it overcomes this pressure. Now that Jeong Kwan-jang has figured that out, he will continue to harass Jung-yoon when the fourth set comes in. That's right

960
02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:33.940
Whether you're bothering me or overcoming the pressure and doing the cover is important now, but in the end, it's confidence. In Ian's most important moment, he shook the ace Jung Yoon-joo of the Ness estuary

961
02:15:34.020 --> 02:15:48.180
Today, Jeong Kwan-jang of the game is winning five points as a sub, Heungkuk Life Insurance is winning three points as a sub, and he is winning seven blocks and 11 blocks as a sub. Are you holding out

962
02:15:48.260 --> 02:16:00.540
It's a fight whether to attack. After 6 years, we won by 1 game. When we played 3 sets today

963
02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:13.440
The players of both teams seem to have poured everything they have, but they still have it. That's right. I said this in the 3rd round, but now all the players who are playing against both teams

964
02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:21.240
It became the moment when the mind dominated the body. That's right. Jeong Kwan-jang, who leads with a set score of 2 to 1, is entering the fourth year of the game.

965
02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:29.540
This is Penn Baker here. The yellow light transfer is the price. In the Eotae Cover Yum

966
02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:32.560
Hoyoung, two-step open spot again

967
02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:46.040
That's right. The atmosphere is again Jeong Kwan-jang, the first goal of the fourth set, so it's inevitable that the atmosphere of Ye will not go up because he's a mega player. Right, the articles of association

968
02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:56.160
There's only one set left for Ae to go to Incheon. That's right. Let's keep going. It was my goal, and the pie in the middle is low. Kim Hyun-kyung

969
02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:59.540
But Kim Yeon-koung's view of the court

970
02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:01.840
It's wider than others. That's right.

971
02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:05.540
I think it's better to take it out in the middle

972
02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:11.940
I knew it was the best course. That's right. It's a better and shorter ball, and it's a more accurate score. Yes

973
02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:19.440
Kim Soo-jae's serve is one to one. Heungkuk Life must lead today's game to five sets

974
02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:23.040
The serve is good. It's coming over. Agar connection to Avenge Songki

975
02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:27.040
This person's 100 o'clock is good. Oh, guess what

976
02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:32.840
First of all, Tutank scored by choosing a fast play in a straight line.

977
02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:36.540
But until the elementary soccer player hits this quick opening

978
02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:39.940
There was no preparation step for the attack. That's right. First of all, targeting the serve

979
02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:45.440
When Kim Suzy hits a serve, I think she scores the most points

980
02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:49.680
That's how it feels. Right. Heungkuk Life is leading 2 to 1

981
02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:54.620
After Pyo Seungjoo gets it, Nam Hyun line's left time difference

982
02:17:54.740 --> 02:18:07.740
Where is this going? Yes, I didn't get broken at all. It was also a time difference between the mega-player who cut about 1m short. It feels like it's passing by. Yes

983
02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:21.900
I really don't think Mega athletes get tired. This ball is inside the left side of Jung Yoon-ju's life. I was wondering what Jung Yoon-joo's attack would be like when I came up to the front

984
02:18:21.980 --> 02:18:34.380
First of all, the burden of receiving, which hit the third set, seems to be a little less. Yes, three to two. One point difference, two to four. Abay

985
02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:39.040
It's stronger. Take that out to the left of seat number one

986
02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:42.640
I'm ready. I saved it. Let's go with Jung Hyun-joo. Oh, team ball

987
02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:53.620
You have to survive like this. The Science and Technology Center, which has a connection to Choi Tae-hoon, who had a good defense of Heungkuk Life Insurance, had a good 4-2 defense

988
02:18:53.700 --> 02:19:03.380
Exactly, Jung Yoon creates a two-legged score. That's right. It's a really picturesque under-link. JUNG YOON JU pulled it out in a perfect straight line

989
02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:08.980
The stooge is short. I saw JEONG WOO YOUNG and it shook. Oh, my arm

990
02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:14.820
I'll raise it. If you're going to sell the floca, catch it. I still have power.

991
02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:24.040
Mega player is amazing. That's right. Director Ko Hee-jin calls the setter of the banquet hall and talks to him separately

992
02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:37.220
Jung Ho-young's defense was 3 to 4 short. I already got the wrong serve mistake in my hand.

993
02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:51.240
No matter how hard you use the dragon, it won't go over. It was decided as soon as I got hit. Yes, director Ko Hee-jin is also disappointed. The serve is Jeong Hyeonju

994
02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:54.760
All right, let's dig in a long way. The serve is good.

995
02:19:54.980 --> 02:19:58.840
Park Eunjin's push score. What's this? Park Eunjin

996
02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:07.320
Do you want me to do a video review?

997
02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:19.700
This is a request for Avon Terminal Director Touchnet requesting a video review. First of all, the placement side gave me an autograph to endure it, but Sung-guk's coach, Avon Danza, finally sees it. You have requested a video review.

998
02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:27.000
Park Eun-ji also has a strange expression. Yes

999
02:20:27.500 --> 02:20:37.880
What does it mean? Should we look at this expression? Park Eunjin scratching from the top, stopping and coming down

1000
02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:48.860
It has been confirmed that the lime is not my touch at all. Wait a minute. As you said, I was a little dissuaded from the bench. On the bench, I gave an autograph to the coach, saying, "I don't think it's right."

1001
02:20:48.940 --> 02:21:02.480
That's what I wanted to do as a tree groom. That's right. Two choices are done by the director. Of course, it's Shin Hyun-kyung on the left side of 20 and Kim Hyun-kyung on the big side. It sounds good.

1002
02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:13.120
6

1003
02:21:13.200 --> 02:21:23.480
I'm going with a calm performance. Yes, Senator Choi Sung-hyun also said that we need to find coolness. Right, Peaches Wag

1004
02:21:24.100 --> 02:21:28.400
The rounder hand connection ball falls back on the ticket holder.

1005
02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:44.740
Mega's right back attack. The netting space is too big. That's right. Maybe it would be better to use it while fitting the breaking in this case, but it wasn't exactly wrapped in my hand because it was too far out. Right.

1006
02:21:44.820 --> 02:21:57.460
Mega's attack error 7 to 4 Tokiruchi Yeom Hye-sun is on the left. It's a rebound. Blocking cover. A long pipe in a bagger

1007
02:21:57.540 --> 02:22:02.040
Light 2 pitches, short left Lee Hyun-kyung and Kim Hyun-kyung

1008
02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:13.940
Now, Kim Yeon-koung completely disappears the opposing defenders by playing with the ball and paint again. Heungkuk Life leads with a double score of 8 to 4. It's Daejeon.

1009
02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:19.120
Compass of Korea's Health

1010
02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:23.360
Korea's First Stomach Health Double Formulation Will Peony

1011
02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:28.340
I'm going to take care of my stomach's health

1012
02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:34.100
As expected, it's an outpatient on the top. If you're curious about MG Saemaul Geumgo insurance

the day before yesterday

1015
02:22:52.620 --> 02:22:54.920
On the day of the third game

1016
02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:58.220
3363 people were with us today

1017
02:22:58.220 --> 02:23:00.920
3,405 fans are with us

1018
02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:07.120
Excuse me. I'm sure this ball is a disappointing game to miss today's game. All right.

1019
02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:10.420
As we're in the fourth set

1020
02:23:10.420 --> 02:23:14.020
Chief Jeong Kwan-jang's attack rate is 40% right now

1021
02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:24.680
Heungkuk Life is 75% now. Yes. Heungkuk Life Insurance, which has a fairly high attack success rate. That's right. Heungkuk Life Insurance's Peaches Abe is overwhelming with 8 to 4 in the fourth set

1022
02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.560
Exhale and nervous. Pyo Seungjoo open ball to the left

1023
02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:44.220
Kim Suzy. It's a five point difference. Are we going to the final again today? I don't know the result, but little by little

1024
02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:49.580
It smells good. That's right. Director Ko Heejin who was looking at this situation

1025
02:23:50.660 --> 02:23:51.860
the Old Master

1026
02:23:52.280 --> 02:24:04.280
Yeom Hyun-seok Back Attack Straits Paint Lee Min-sun Goes to Back Attack Pig Night Bagertec. Mega-straight attack mistake

1027
02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:15.860
Well, I'm not sure. Maybe it's a situation where I'm handing the mood over to the other person. Yes, he's cutting off the flow. Time-out articles of association

1028
02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:21.880
Swing, swing, happiness

1029
02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:30.940
The drum needs to sling. Since we have a serve

1030
02:24:31.140 --> 02:24:42.800
You just have to follow it step by step. Don't rush into one side, but you can go if you think about catching one on two. Yes. One by one

1031
02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:49.080
I told you. This set isn't over yet

1032
02:24:49.320 --> 02:25:01.460
This is the beginning of the fourth set. Yes, it's 4:09 now, so the players have been playing for almost 2 hours and 10 minutes. Yes

1033
02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:13.440
It's a much longer time when you start preparing for the game and warming up. That's right. It came out almost an hour ago and the players started warming up, so yes, it's 3 hours and 10 minutes. That's right. From Beaver Spy Fate

1034
02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:15.740
He's so experienced. Yes

1035
02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:28.840
Even if it's a short setter, Yeom Hye-sun's pass paint catches the opponent off guard when he's in an avant-garde. That's right. First of all, he's looking at the empty seats that well. Yes, we usually joke around

1036
02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:34.140
It's said that your eyes are on the back of your head, but that's what it looks like now. Choi Seungjae's own money

1037
02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:42.640
Pushing in the second-tier comrade. Let's move on to the left, Kim Hyun-kyung. Chance Ball Jeong Kwanjae Levant

1038
02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:55.140
It was rolling and falling on the court and being hit by the net, but it got to a position where I couldn't defend. Choi Dong-gyu could have moved if he had that much rebound

1039
02:25:55.220 --> 02:26:03.740
It's also seen as having a lot of energy. Right. That means your legs don't move well. 6/10 combination point-by-point receiving shake

1040
02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:19.500
I can't hit this cheek. Oh, it was short, and the cover of Yeom In-seon's Levertek Attack was put on as a lifestyles this time. This is Kim Suji throwing her body behind her, inside the line of Kim Yeon-koung

1041
02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:22.140
He's really good at setting the attack tempo. Yes

1042
02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:35.400
So now, the setter didn't post it, and it wasn't a normal situation. Yes. You have to align it as if you were jumping in place and deflect the breaking. You have to look at the defense, too. Kim Yeon-kyung is good at volleyball. That's right.

1043
02:26:35.480 --> 02:26:44.700
11

1044
02:26:45.140 --> 02:26:53.840
I got a mega-piercing from the number one spot to the light by ball. All right. You're a great player. Yes

1045
02:26:53.920 --> 02:27:08.880
So, the players in both teams are Kim Hyun-kyung, you're the player, but what kind of atmosphere the players create at some point has a really big impact on the team's atmosphere in the end. Right. Park Hyunjin's defense

1046
02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:10.760
7

1047
02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:17.480
It was Shin Hyun-kyung Yvonne. This is fan Kim Hyun-kyung.

1048
02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:30.060
Dukiewicz was almost in fourth place right now. That's right. I was on this side, and Jung Woo-young only looks at Kim Yeon-kyung in the front, but the four angles are too deep.

1049
02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:44.520
Kim Hyun-kyung, who is showing a huge price, blew the rundead pass spike in the yellow kite of Pokirech Kim Hyun-kyung, which was not able to float even though it was overindicated. Bookletch

1050
02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:59.100
They are Jeong Kwan-jang's players who judge that they should not allow any more points, and if they are four points apart, they are still in the top four points. Of course, Heungkuk Life needs to earn a little more here to run a stable four-set game. Yes

1051
02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:03.200
the sun's ultraviolet rays

1052
02:28:03.780 --> 02:28:18.280
I was in a bit of a hurry to start with the toss of the serve mistake. Thirteen-to-eight, so the best place is when Yeom Hye-sun hits the serve, and if it fails, Heungkuk Life is grateful. Yes

1053
02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:32.180
From the 5 point difference, Kim Suzy's serve, Kim Suzy's serve order came. That's right. It's the opposite situation. It was too floating in the garden in the middle of Pyo Seung-ju's Yummi Line.

1054
02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:41.340
Behind Kim Hyun-kyung's pass, hit, spy tee, and change, there are three block condet touches in front.

1055
02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:51.320
It was a good opportunity for Heungkuk Life due to the opposite situation, but another time, the cider went back anyway. That's right. That's Kim Soo-jae's serve. Right.

1056
02:28:51.400 --> 02:29:03.720
From the serve of both teams, Kim Soo-jin's sub damage Yeom Hye-sun's sub damage seems to be the biggest. Yes, Tokiri Chess Abe No. 2 is straight.

1057
02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:18.560
Tutuku's outside swing was really deep right now. That's right. If that doesn't hit you sensibly, there is a high possibility that it will go outside, but yes, I used my wrist well. It sticks to the line. That's right.

1058
02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:31.240
It goes to the opening of the Tutko member, who took almost the thinnest side of the ball as if he was beating it out of the way. Kim Hyun-kyung and Jung Yoon-joo

1059
02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:32.680
I am doing.

1060
02:29:33.100 --> 02:29:44.460
Heungkuk Life Insurance is running away one more point. Yes, I'm getting more and more stable. First of all, Heungkuk Life is fortunate that Jung Yu-joo is doing well in the fourth set. Yes

1061
02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:57.240
I thought the three sets of receiving damage would be the biggest, but I overcame it on my own. That's right. Seo Bin, Yeon Woo-sun without a first-pitch rotation. We have a rear-end attack on the center. Song Hae-rin

1062
02:29:58.280 --> 02:30:02.820
10

1063
02:30:03.020 --> 02:30:07.660
If it happens, it's the articles of association that you have to prepare for the 5th set. Yes

1064
02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:14.540
Now, which player will dominate this flow perfectly?

1065
02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:26.760
At times like this, the crazy player should come out like that. Shoe shot the side five minutes ago. a mobile gun and a light-out home thread

1066
02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:28.840
then

1067
02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:43.560
As it goes wrong on the side, Shin Eun-ji has one more sub-tempo. Yes, in the end, it's a 4-point gap again. That's right. If it's 11 to 15 letters, you can also aim for the middle pipe.

1068
02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:51.460
Shin Eun-ji's continuous serve, Kim Hyun-kyung, and the goal of moving the facts

1069
02:30:51.660 --> 02:30:59.580
All right. Mega is ready. From Yum to Mega. the greatest number of consecutive goals

1070
02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:10.480
Now, when the rebound was already made, Mega was almost perfectly on the offensive step. The Yeom Hye-sun Center delivers it accurately. Heungkuk Life Time Out

1071
02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:45.760
So, the part that manager Avonjada keeps talking with veterans is that he's following the 4th place

1072
02:31:46.080 --> 02:32:00.980
So, when Lee Si-woo came out from the front, give it to Peach at some point or because it's clearly different when Fife and Kim Yeon-kyung were in the middle and when Jung Yoon-joo was in the front. It's a promised play

1073
02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:14.660
I think that's a little off. 12 to 153 points, 3 consecutive Sua was shown and shook. Jeong Yun-ju is ready to the left. Shin Eun-ji tk is eliminated. Choi Seung-joon

1074
02:32:15.380 --> 02:32:18.920
That's how I got hit. This is out. Right. Blue car

1075
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:27.100
So, from the angle of attack, if the blocking doesn't fit like that, it can't bounce in the opposite direction. As long as it's white-colored

1076
02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:31.600
You must have fallen on the court of the articles of association. It fits your right hand and the angle is completely bent.

1077
02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:37.900
Now it's 13 to 15 points apart by two points. Whether you hit it or not, you hit it more forcefully.

1078
02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:41.680
It falls at the other end here.

1079
02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:50.300
Too big. I took a breather. The score is a three-point gap.

1080
02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:56.480
We say this when our minds and steps are light. Lalala Light Step

1081
02:32:57.240 --> 02:33:01.720
Light with overwhelming lightness

1082
02:33:02.080 --> 02:33:06.100
3

1083
02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:21.080
Welcome to the spring of Nordisk High Nordisk

1084
02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:39.840
The score is 16 to 13 Heungkuk Life is leading by three points. In a situation where the double score was wide, Jeong Kwan-jang's pursuit continues. That's right. First of all, Shin Eun Ji is preparing to be replaced

1085
02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:51.000
We have narrowed the gap between 5 points as we came in to 3 points. Park Soo Hyun is taking another chance for Heungkuk Life Insurance

1086
02:33:51.080 --> 02:34:00.340
Whether one side-out turns here or Park Ji-hyun's serve timing gets longer, the current flow may be the most important situation. Right.

1087
02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:08.920
Park Soo-hyun's serve servo performance is perfect. Oh, the serve goes in well. It's long behind both lines and it's over

1088
02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:22.860
Mega, the pitch really followed well. He turns Park Soo-hyun's sub turn at once. That's right. First, let's take a breather and it's a two-point gap again. Yes. A mega that spins diagonally

1089
02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:37.260
Now, he blocks Kim Young-kyun's right hand and hits the pitch player's hand. Yes, Megase. Yes, the flow wasn't right, but we're moving on. Bloke out, two, one ball that you cut in Daejeon

1090
02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:42.040
The pitching player helped me tremendously. When I entered the back of the attack line

1091
02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:49.740
It went in zigzag steps from side to side. That's right. Now Lee Gu-won completely lost his balance as his receiving faltered. Yes, and then the cheeks that I pierced briefly

1092
02:34:49.740 --> 02:34:51.840
I used it as a step

1093
02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:54.040
You really take your swing neatly. That's right.

1094
02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:56.340
17

1095
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:04.760
It's underhand, and it's light fiber. Mega

1096
02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:19.900
It works. This angle and this strong attack is still possible to this day for a mega player. Yes. Mega really doesn't seem to get tired.

1097
02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:27.640
The flow may be bad, but yes, I'm not tired. Good serve goes in as you hit it. Left

1098
02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:40.760
The same goes for Kim Hyun-kyung inside the line. Yes, because he's Kim Hyun-kyung who's been through all the prenatal and aerial battles. No matter how much pressure the other side puts

1099
02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:48.960
Kim Yeon-kyung can handle the ball as long as it comes up accurately. Yes, the children's guest in this ward

1100
02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:52.300
Yellow

1101
02:35:53.100 --> 02:36:06.720
In Yum, Tokirakech scores to the left. Like the 3rd set, director Jung is coming in at the 4th set, but yes

1102
02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:17.440
Looking at the current trend, we can catch it anytime. Also, Heungkuk Life has come to the point that it can run away at any time. Right, Park Hyunjin 16 to 182 points

1103
02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:28.100
I'm going to go to these pants on the left. In the front, there's a team class

1104
02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:41.880
I caught him. Now Bukirich is a little... How should I say this? The jump was fast, but it wasn't the right timing to go up, so I got caught in the brewing. Yes, I'm very drawn to it because I'm going up and down.

1105
02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:56.100
Two-to-avoid-locking. It's a breaking of two-to-two players who can't miss it again. Yes, 19 to 163 points, Heungkuk Life is going to the side-outback as it wants. That's right. Kim Hyunkyung

1106
02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:57.000
Yellow

1107
02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:08.480
I opened it with my underhand. After hesitating, raise the key with chance ball No. 2 left and Jung Yoon-joo's underhand, go to the left. Oak

1108
02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:23.660
It's noisy. Rather, the dull drop scored four more points. I don't think bookies players are tired right now.

1109
02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:27.600
It bends against Kim Soo-jae's hand.

1110
02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:49.340
Yes. Long touch out Kim Hyun-kyung is overcoming the crisis with just one side out of the Yeom Hye-sun center. Yes, now it's Kim Su-ji's sub-tempo. Oh, it's also expensive. That's right.

1111
02:37:49.420 --> 02:38:00.040
This is director Ko Hee-jin, who requests a video review at this time by a score of 20 to 173. Both teams have one operation time left, yes

1112
02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:09.040
Jeonghan Yang's team requested a video review of the player's foul in the future. Video review request for later player fouls.

1113
02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:24.120
Yes, it has been confirmed that it is not Kim Hyun-kyung, who was going up very well.

1114
02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:38.460
The coaches of both teams seem to want to break the opponent's flow in some way. That's right. Heungkuk Life Insurance, which has to lead to 5 sets with a difference of 20 to 173

1115
02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:47.140
Kim Hyun-kyung's successful attack rate in the fourth set is 88%. Yes. Kim Suzy's class

1116
02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:51.000
three rounds of the yellow banquets

1117
02:38:54.180 --> 02:39:08.380
So, Kim Hyun-kyung slowed down a little in the first set and started to concentrate, and is now making the highest score in the team. That's right. Rookie Ritchie's serve with a 2 point difference

1118
02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:12.060
Kim Hyun-kyung gets it, Vigo, and Jung Yoon-jae to the left

1119
02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:26.960
Jung Yoon-joon is also fully revived in the fourth set. Yes, I'm Jung Yoon-joo, who's going to score 12 points now. I like Jung Yoon-joo today.

1120
02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:33.100
All right, 66% success rate of 4 points. the third of the most special zone

1121
02:39:33.820 --> 02:39:45.140
Here's Jung Woo-young. In the middle of touch time, Jung Ho-young's attack keeps getting caught by the pitch player. Yes, yes.

1122
02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:57.280
Now, the receiving is still shaking, and the pitch player was moving to catch the mega player, but now that he's here, he can't choose the exact location. Yes

1123
02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:03.340
19-21 Jeong Ho-young, the chief of the articles of association, who still has an opponent within the range

1124
02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:21.680
Tutuq Ja Tutuq is still alive. Yes, it creates a very strong attack. Twenty-one, so when players start to focus on doing it

1125
02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:28.180
You're trying to attack this hard. That's right. Jung Yunjoo's "Aso-ed"

1126
02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:41.500
Doran receives it and it's out blue out mega with 100 hours of banquets. After today's game, your players will probably

1127
02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:53.580
You'll be exhausted, but all you have to do is to endure it with your mental strength while playing. Right, 20 to 22 points. 2 points difference

1128
02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:59.400
Mega's third Kim Hyun-kyung is an accurate receiving, one point, and second baseman rebound.

1129
02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:10.220
I blocked it and put it up. I can't hit Seungjun Koo. It has become a stretching cover for the left side of the pitch that cuts in front of the chance ball.

1130
02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:19.560
I'm handing it over again this time. Ta-ball, goal, move, attack. So, when you get a rebound

1131
02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:33.360
When Park Hae-min signed the call, Mega should have been out as an escort attack, but from there, the movement was twisted. Oh, so from the perspective of the president of the articles of association, I had no choice but to keep passing it. Right.

1132
02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:43.520
It's okay. Hana, Hana, Hana, you said you'll get a chance. We shouldn't be in a hurry.

1133
02:41:43.700 --> 02:41:51.920
I told you not to try to catch Blue King Surrey, the worst thing right now

1134
02:41:53.020 --> 02:42:03.600
I can't catch the ball. Stay still. Don't wave your hand. Stay still

1135
02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:13.260
In the end, it's one connection. One connection is a counterattack, and the counterattack eventually increases the team's atmosphere and catches the set. Yes

1136
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:27.060
That was director Ko Hee-jin who talked about blocking. It's this part. Yes, Park Hye-min caught this part and Mega should have fallen behind, but he couldn't even make an attack. In the end, Mega caught it. That's right. Yes

1137
02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:31.940
Choi Eun Ji of Saben

1138
02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:37.740
20

1139
02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:44.520
No spin, no spin. Get the life medal

1140
02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:58.760
It's inside. It's in. First of all, we turned Choi Eun-ji's serve right away. The score that Heungkuk Life Insurance needs is a tie if the two-point Jeong Kwan-jang grabs the advantage. Yes

1141
02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:11.820
21

1142
02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:15.160
Now we have a chance. To the left. Okay

1143
02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:22.840
The result is a one-point difference. First of all, Pyo Seung-soo's serve was very good. Heungkuk Life Time Out

1144
02:43:45.340 --> 02:44:00.180
You have to catch four sets to get another chance. Right. In the third set, Jung Yoon-soo's facial expression is going to hit the serve side, but if it shakes, we have to overcome it now

1145
02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:09.980
I have Kim Yeon-koung on this side, so one side out seems to be done, but your blocking height is now Ahn Hye-rim has gone in to prevent it. Yes

1146
02:44:10.380 --> 02:44:23.940
In addition, setter Lee Go-eun is Jeon. As Soobin comes in, he relieves Jung Yu-jin's burden. That's right. Do Subin's Pyo Seungjoo's sub, Do Subin's Recipe Garden, left, play No. 2

1147
02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:38.500
So in the end, each of these replacement players is connected to the team's operation. That's right. With Kim Hyun-kyung's score, Heungkuk Life's three points are the beauty of volleyball. Yes

1148
02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:49.320
When Doshi-min came in, Jung Yu-jin was out and he made it into a play. That's right. The three points of happiness is

1149
02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:52.020
the Shindoran section

1150
02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:07.080
Let's go with five sets. Let's check it out first. I'm director Ko Hee-jin asking for a video review. It falls to the back

1151
02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:13.460
I caught one breaking, but I checked until the end and asked for a video review of all four touches.

1152
02:45:28.460 --> 02:45:41.340
It has been confirmed that Kim Hyun-kyung and Kim Soo-jin are not my touch. That's right. There was no senior team. Then, Dodrami 2024 2025 v League Women's Championship Series

1153
02:45:41.420 --> 02:45:55.000
We're going to the final three games in a row. The set is almost over, but the players are playing for two and a half hours. Yes

1154
02:45:55.080 --> 02:46:02.600
I can predict it, but no one knows the outcome of the game. I'll see you in a little while. It's Daejeon.

1155
02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:25.100
Do you know why a dodram is the number one? Experts who preserve freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. 1st place to make a lot of money. 1st place to make a lot of money. 1st place to make a lot of delicious food

1156
02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:33.720
It's a perfect age to see the second child in an era of prolonged youth. It's the perfect age to get a new job.

1157
02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:40.360
Insurance plays a longer role for your longer youth. Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd

1158
02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:58.820
Heungkuk Life Insurance Co., Ltd., which has to lift the trophy here in Daejeon today, actually, on the day of the third match the day before yesterday, not only the four Kobo officials but also the Heungkuk Life officials

1159
02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:13.540
We set up the winning banner and podium and finished the rehearsal. That's right. We couldn't do it then. Since we don't know how the results will turn out, it's a given that we have to prepare. That's right

1160
02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:27.520
The set we need for the fish team is now one set. If the head of Yejeong wins, he will go back to square one and go to Incheon. Yes, if Heungkuk Life wins, the trophy goes to Heungkuk Life. That's right.

1161
02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:37.320
Heungkuk Life, who won the fourth set 25 to 22, still showed an edge in blocking. Really now

1162
02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:51.340
Even at the edge of the cliff, it's crowded in the last corner. That's right. But as I said before, the players of both teams showed great performance in this championship game

1163
02:47:51.420 --> 02:48:05.400
I hope that the people watching will give a round of applause to the players who fought so hard. That's right. It's really mental now. Yes. Mega 50% of attack share of 39%

1164
02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:11.140
Kim Yeon-koung is showing her unique attack success rate. When you look at the guns of both teams

1165
02:48:11.220 --> 02:48:13.920
Kim Yeon-koung and Mega's attack share is

1166
02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:18.720
It's almost the same. That's right. First of all, Mega and Kim Yeonkyung

1167
02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:21.220
It's a situation where you can't help but be at the center

1168
02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:24.720
Because of this, the two players are responsible. You have to watch it like that, too

1169
02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:30.620
How boldly will he try to serve and break the attack in the 5th set

1170
02:48:30.620 --> 02:48:36.920
It's that fight now. I hope you don't regret it. Jeonggwanjang Red Sparks has been on the show for the first time in 133 years

1171
02:48:36.920 --> 02:48:39.020
the championship series being played

1172
02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:43.720
There's only one set left to go to the 5th round

1173
02:48:43.720 --> 02:48:47.520
On the other hand, he won the overall title in 6 years

1174
02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:51.520
Kim Hyunkyung, who has only one set left

1175
02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:56.120
It's Heungkuk Life. It's really in the fog. No one knows.

1176
02:48:57.540 --> 02:49:10.180
Let's go to Daejeon or Incheon. First, the first serve is Yeom Hye-sun setter. If this happens, there will be no change in the lineup that both teams entered in the fourth set.

1177
02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:23.680
And let's see if volleyball emperor Kim Hyun-kyung's Last Dance ends this series with that wonderful dance move today. Let's go with five sets. a two-ball tie

1178
02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:29.320
I think Jung Woo Hyun is

1179
02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:42.880
The timing was so right that I said I had been waiting. As you move one step, your right hand goes in perfectly. Jung Ho-young's solo block was caught 1:04 times.

1180
02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:51.960
The direction of the serve mistake would have been Jung Yoon-joo, but he couldn't cross the net. First of all, Jung Yoon-joo took a breather. Yes

1181
02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:56.680
Director Ko Heejin, director Abonja

1182
02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:01.100
It's the same as my lips are burning up. I'm skinny, too. Yes

1183
02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:06.220
Kim Soo-ji's So Ah-eun

1184
02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:15.120
Pyo Seung-ju Banquet Sun Jung Ho-yong hits you. Successful tee shot, Kim Seokhwan

1185
02:50:16.740 --> 02:50:29.860
After the rebound in the important Taigang, the real Lee Go-eun setter put a perfect fastball on the pitch player. That's right. Anilis Peach scored 12 points today

1186
02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:41.720
Good. Peach Kim Soo-jin Suavs is making 2 out of 5 fastballs today

1187
02:50:41.960 --> 02:50:44.960
Yum Min-seop and Gookey came in.

1188
02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:56.380
Hey, it's strong. Now, the current offensive power was enough to bounce off the defense. Yes

1189
02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:04.700
Oh, your mental strength is amazing. It's a 2 to 2 tie, and it drops like Dokiri Chess. This ball goes back

1190
02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:10.660
It was the furthest place on the left. That's right.

1191
02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:25.440
If there was a strong ball from a Bunny Lips player, Tutuk makes a deep angle that the defense can't do while catching an RBI. Yes. Two to two. Three to two

1192
02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:30.200
2

1193
02:51:32.980 --> 02:51:45.300
Beach player's breaking will be powerful again today. Time-out full stadium

1194
02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:59.980
You hit the ball well. When you serve, let's do it a little bit more

1195
02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:13.560
We shouldn't get excited. Let's get excited. Let's do it. Fighting pie. Now, the players of both teams have to trust each other. By all means.

1196
02:52:13.640 --> 02:52:20.620
You can't play preparing for the cover. Scenes that you might regret shouldn't be produced. Yes

1197
02:52:20.880 --> 02:52:31.440
Both the players on the court are showing the best, or worse, today. Tutuko's Bl

1198
02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:38.540
Kim Hyun-kyung, who is doing well after catching the AIDS ball in Yum. Here we go. Touch out

1199
02:52:38.620 --> 02:52:51.680
Let's give him a round of applause. Lee Go-hoon showed a really professional side. That's right. He flies to the opponent's bench and runs to the end with his determination to catch the ball.

1200
02:52:51.760 --> 02:53:00.860
Lee Goeun, who shows great tenacity, gradually scored 3 to 4 points

1201
02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:04.160
Shin Eun Ji

1202
02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:07.760
That's right.

1203
02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:22.860
Shin Eun-ji kept hitting her serve towards the diagonal player, but did she see Shin Eun-kyung move? You're suddenly aiming for a straight line. Shin Eun Ji's Championship Series draw

1204
02:53:22.940 --> 02:53:30.160
It's on the first serve. In this critical situation. It finally exploded. Let's go back in. to a place like tax evasion

1205
02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:49.300
Therefore, there is a Korean life, Jeong Yoon-ju. Wow, Jung Yoon-joo has grown a lot. Yes, in fact, if I couldn't turn it here, Shin Eun-ji's wave offensive could have continued. Right.

1206
02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:58.840
Jung Yoon-soo takes a break and Park Soo-hyun comes in. Yes, I'm praying for 5 to 4

1207
02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:10.400
Jeon Yu-hyun is Park Eun-jin's sub, Park Soo-hyun, Pyo Seung-joo, and spy mega to the back

1208
02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:20.640
Now, after overcoming another difficult crisis at once, Park Soo-hyun lost his chance to serve with a side-out at once. That's right.

1209
02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:34.420
On the side of Kim Hyun-kyung's avant-garde side, there is Kim Hyun-kyung's pitch player. Mega's service will be replaced. The serve mistake has already fallen too far back.

1210
02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:47.500
Actually, this series doesn't fit well with the two-toots during the spike serve. That's right. You have to throw it forward and hit it as you go into the same situation as the attack, but you jumped into place.

1211
02:54:47.580 --> 02:54:51.640
Anielles Catch 13 points in today's game and six blocks among them.

1212
02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:58.620
I'm moving on. I'm turning it over with pass paint, but it's off the sideline.

1213
02:54:58.700 --> 02:55:07.060
Would this fit Kim Hyun-kyung's hand? The number of balls he is consulting with coach Lee Kwang-soo increases. Let's check first. Right.

1214
02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:11.540
Request a video review.

1215
02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:24.540
Kim Hyun-kyung's video review of the blocker touchout in Kim Han-young's team reached out, but since he has a basic height, his hand comes up to the net.

1216
02:55:27.720 --> 02:55:29.900
That's right. It's coming up. Yes

1217
02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:41.940
It would be better to see from the back. Yes, if you look here

1218
02:55:43.860 --> 02:55:55.720
The reading confirmed that it was no touch. That's right. It was confirmed right before the frame was out. That's right. Yes, first of all, there was no shaking on the fingers of the left hand. That's right.

1219
02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:02.460
The miscalculation score of the banquet line is 7/52 for Fitz's consecutive serve

1220
02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:17.280
Bukirich Underland Connection One-Step Oh Seung-joo was also hit by the inside of the line blocking and came into the line. That's right. The score difference was 6 to 7

1221
02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:25.460
Pyo Seung-soo is now out to the back. It's a fight between Yeom Hye-sun and whether to change the breaking position or not

1222
02:56:25.620 --> 02:56:27.680
Now, it gets complicated in my head.

1223
02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:35.760
The score is 1 point difference. 12 points today. Park Suhyun. The left wing line

1224
02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:51.400
Now, shall we ask for a video review? Yes, we don't do a video review. He's trying to catch it first. Yes, the score is 8 to 6

1225
02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:53.760
Change the positions of both teams' courts.

1226
02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:04.880
There was already a finger shaking.

1227
02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:20.300
Heungkuk Life is ahead by two points. Regardless of the in-out, Kim Hyun-kyung's last attack was already hit by our hands. Yes, it's been decided.

1228
02:57:29.460 --> 02:57:42.340
It's a one-point difference. The gap between one and two points continues to go to the seesaw game. Yes, 7 to 8

1229
02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:45.960
I'm sure there will be a flow for both teams at least once. Yes

1230
02:57:46.060 --> 02:57:59.020
Park Eun-jin gets hit 100 times and moves on. Kim Hyun-kyung on the left side of the second ball. Kim Hyun-kyung

1231
02:57:59.100 --> 02:58:11.360
Kim Hyun-kyung has really good concentration. Yes, Kim Hyun-kyung is back in the fifth set mode of the second game.

1232
02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:22.860
The score was 9 to 7 Jung Yoon-joo returned to the potential. Yes, without Park Sihyun. Jung Yunju and Kim Hyunkyung's third

1233
02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:31.480
Yum Hoi-seon is a dry bar and it's a rebound. I got it. Lee Goeun's number of selections. Scoring

1234
02:58:33.540 --> 02:58:48.020
Heungkuk Life Insurance runs away by three consecutive points. Now we're a little closer to winning. If you look at it now

1235
02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:50.400
It's a little bit different

1236
02:58:50.660 --> 02:59:03.440
We can't play high-ball blocking now after hitting the serve, and we miss all the balls that we can defend on the ball

1237
02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:11.400
Why don't you think about Kang Taep? You still have a chance

1238
02:59:12.440 --> 02:59:23.920
It's not over yet. Yes. If I get one side out, I'll get two points now. In Heungkuk Life, when he got a rebound

1239
02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:32.940
Lee Kun-hoon has to keep the choice of counterattack in mind, and that's right. In the end, Yeom Hye-sun center is in the same situation now. Kim Hyun-kyung's consecutive numbers

1240
02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:38.640
I'm going to open the yellow and go back. Life Five Mega

1241
02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:53.840
First of all, believing in Shin Hyun-kyung's defense from the back, Jung Yoo-jin pulled the inside a little, but first, he pierced another one with his power. Yes, first of all, we succeeded in the side-out as we hoped, and it became a two-point difference. That's right.

1242
02:59:53.920 --> 02:59:58.140
8

1243
03:00:01.540 --> 03:00:11.200
I thought I'd get a chance if I got one point over the hump, but I'll just let it go Heungkuk Life's Time Out

1244
03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:36.020
Once again, Yeom Hye-sun hits the serve, so director Jeong's breaking height is the highest brokers.

1245
03:00:36.100 --> 03:00:50.540
It's time for Jung Yoon-joo to endure receiving and Shin Hyun-kyung to cover it, and this one serve can determine today's winning move.

1246
03:00:50.620 --> 03:01:05.020
Yeom Hye-sun, who caused the most pain to Shin Hyun-kyung, is back to the back-to-back serve of Yeom Hye-sun. Yes, Jung Hyun-joo is shaking. I'm going behind the second ball. Yellow gemstone throwing an odd take

1247
03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:24.100
Is it unfolding like this? The game comes back to square one. One more time, Yeom Hye-sun's serve cannon continues. If this happens, the receiving side gets a lot more pressure. Right.

1248
03:01:24.200 --> 03:01:33.100
Let's do Sam Hyunsuk's serve again. Shin Hyun-kyung threw two first pitches after this. Here we go. Tybeth 1

1249
03:01:44.220 --> 03:01:58.960
There's nothing to be urgent about succeeding in the turnaround, but it's because I'm nervous right now. Yes, Heungkuk Life is in a hurry right now. That's right. Let's continue

1250
03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:09.560
It's Yeom Hye-sun's serve timing. 11 to 10 Yeom Hye-sun, let's go again. Blocking again, 2 pitches and 28 pitches. I'm ready.

1251
03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:15.260
And the left side, Bookie Rich descendant, twice

1252
03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:40.700
The inability to connect Mega's location quickly reversed the atmosphere as Vicky Rich caught Kim Seung-gyu again. It's leaning completely towards the articles of association.

1253
03:02:56.380 --> 03:02:57.780
Come out to the right. Come out to the right

1254
03:02:59.420 --> 03:03:13.920
The opportunity continues to come toward Heungkuk Life, but it is being countered by failing to take advantage of the opportunity. Yes, from 8 points to 12 points, Yeom Hye-sun is only targeting right now. Right.

1255
03:03:14.100 --> 03:03:18.860
You have to endure sub-receiving. Heungkuk Life that has to endure

1256
03:03:18.960 --> 03:03:19.920
Kim Hyun-kyung

1257
03:03:20.100 --> 03:03:22.520
Your score may be 12 times.

1258
03:03:23.300 --> 03:03:31.540
In the fifth consecutive pioneer, Jung Yoon-joo got it all. Trish Jeonghwa is holding pen number 2 to the left. Jeong Yunju

1259
03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:42.180
Jung Yoon-joo, who chose the direction rather than the self-defense ball, passed a difficult crisis for now. Now, on the other side

1260
03:03:42.260 --> 03:03:55.740
This ball is really important because it's Jung Kim Soo-ji's serve. It's Kim Su-ji by 11 to 121 points. You're watching the all-time championship game.

1261
03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:57.260
The song

1262
03:03:57.700 --> 03:04:12.400
It's Guki-ru-out with a hundred o'clock. I'm overcoming the crisis once again. Coach Ko Jin reinforces the height as Lee Sun-woo enters now.

1263
03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:13.700
Yes

1264
03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:28.080
Docky Rich Blue Out Scorer If this happens, I'm not sure. I think Jung Ho-young will go to the bigger side rather than the west wind here. Jeonggwanjang Incheon seems to be getting closer. I don't know all of them yet

1265
03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:37.440
The government's partner

1266
03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:49.040
It gets closer little by little with the cloth. Now, the center chose a pitch player in the front, but Jung Woo-young did not miss it again and let him rebound.

1267
03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:53.160
Director Jeong's Ness Point

1268
03:04:53.420 --> 03:04:57.560
First of all, I caught it well and caught it with poetry.

1269
03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:09.080
Hit the secondary ball net. 12 vs 14 First, you have two chances. Yes

1270
03:05:09.560 --> 03:05:15.540
It's a special zone player's serve

1271
03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:25.340
Oh Goeun player Jung Yoonju pitch player, where should we go? 12 to 142 points difference. Two, two, yellow

1272
03:05:33.180 --> 03:05:46.360
Now we're dragging this series to Icheon. Hey, this is the kind of championship that volleyball fans can watch until Game 5.

1273
03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:59.720
The all-time game continues to be shown. Jeong Kwan-jang, who gave up Game 12, will come to Daejeon, his home, and collapse Game 34.

1274
03:05:59.800 --> 03:06:13.960
What if we're having a hard time? With this good performance, the players of both teams are doing their best, and the concentration seems to be better

1275
03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:20.280
The pressure of having to endure receiving couldn't withstand it, and Yeom Hye-sun's

1276
03:06:20.380 --> 03:06:34.040
As it took time to serve, that one spot eventually made Heungkuk Life sick. That's right. Today's last rally, the last point of the game, the set-up of Yeonhasan, I'm going to dig straight in with a hard hit.

1277
03:06:34.120 --> 03:06:46.120
In the end, this match was taken to Samsan World Gymnasium in Incheon, which is now the starting point. The mega player's powerful shot that makes it to the starting point

1278
03:06:46.200 --> 03:06:58.280
Now, as we said, the game continues to be a game that no one knows in the fog. Director Jung, director Ko Heejin, and Yum Hyeseon are all yellow

1279
03:06:58.360 --> 03:07:10.300
It becomes a series that turns the game to the starting point like a miracle created by all players. That's right. Both teams need to prepare for the 5th game. I think today

1280
03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:23.940
Uh, as soon as we warm up after this game, we move to Incheon, and now what we need the most is conditioning. Yes, how do you rest? Eat well and the day after tomorrow

1281
03:07:24.020 --> 03:07:27.960
It's a battle about whether to make a good condition in the game

1282
03:07:28.060 --> 03:07:42.720
Hey, I really don't know the results now. That's right. A little while ago, Mega's aunt was shown with his boyfriend D.O. Nord Vandrasi, today's game

1283
03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:53.360
There are a lot of players to meet. Yes, yes. We want to meet all the players from the winning team, but after the last score

1284
03:07:53.440 --> 03:08:05.860
Uh, before the interview came out, my eyes were already red. That's right. It was the mega player's expression when he entered the stadium today, and when he was preparing for the game

1285
03:08:07.020 --> 03:08:10.380
When I was playing the game today

1286
03:08:10.680 --> 03:08:20.640
The yellow Yum Hye-sun and Park Eun-jin, who really got hurt, and Mega made the last point

1287
03:08:20.860 --> 03:08:33.040
He showed a great game today, with 38 points and one serve. Mega scored 38 points today

1288
03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:40.140
The attack success rate is 47%. The average for four seasons was 48%, but today's attack success rate was exactly that

1289
03:08:40.420 --> 03:08:54.280
It shows the attack in Game 4 of the very important Champ that shows exactly why the No. 1 player is a mega player. Let's meet Mega right away. Announcer Kim Se-yeon. Yes, let's meet Jung Kwan-jang's mega player right away.

1290
03:08:54.360 --> 03:09:02.620
Once again, we all made a miraculous victory. At the center of it was Mega. How do you feel about just finishing the 5th set?

1291
03:09:23.900 --> 03:09:27.200
Yes, first of all, thank you so much. I have friends

1292
03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:29.800
That's why I was able to come all the way here.

1293
03:09:29.800 --> 03:09:35.700
My friends believed in me and I believed in myself, so I think I can give you a result like this.

1294
03:09:35.700 --> 03:09:41.700
Yes, we've played a total of 7 games in 13 days. We'll cheer up like this

1295
03:09:41.700 --> 03:09:45.400
I'm curious about the driving force behind it. Where was the driving force?

1296
03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:08.000
Yes, I've been pushing myself to the maximum.

1297
03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:12.000
Not just me, but all the players are sick. Still

1298
03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:16.100
I think we were able to come this far by pushing our best.

1299
03:10:16.100 --> 03:10:18.800
Yes, it's a drama that everyone created together.

1300
03:10:18.800 --> 03:10:27.520
Your eyes look red as you come for an interview. Can you tell me how you feel?

1301
03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:53.300
Yes, it was so impressive and touching that my eyes were a little teary. I think I was able to do it this far because my friends were with me. I really didn't want to lose, so I think I came this far.

1302
03:10:53.380 --> 03:11:02.120
Yes, I think the reason why Mega was able to perform so well is because of his boyfriend's support. Please say what you want to say to your boyfriend.

1303
03:11:15.400 --> 03:11:27.560
Oh, thank you so much for being my boyfriend, thank you to my aunt, thank you to my mom at home, and thank you for praying. Yes, congratulations once again on the mega player's victory.

1304
03:11:29.320 --> 03:11:35.920
Thank you. Thank you. Yes, we met the mega player of director Jeong.

1305
03:11:36.920 --> 03:11:45.880
Yes, not only this boyfriend D.O. but also your aunt was with you today

1306
03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:57.100
In fact, the men's v-League championship match ended in a one-sided series with a total of 3 to 0. That's right. Yes, first of all

1307
03:11:57.540 --> 03:12:00.040
It's been 13 years since I played in the finals

1308
03:12:00.320 --> 03:12:12.360
Because they are the players of Jung Kwan-jang Oh, I think the biggest mental strength was that I couldn't see them raise the trophy at home. That's right. Right now

1309
03:12:12.440 --> 03:12:18.080
There's a yellow player who's ready for the second interview. Yes, actually

1310
03:12:18.180 --> 03:12:29.300
Yellow player's injury Many players have injuries, but especially on the back of Libero's side, this yellow player's fighting spirit has to deal with a lot of things

1311
03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:35.200
If you didn't have any mental strength, you wouldn't have had a hard time winning this second game

1312
03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:48.820
He is a yellow player who performed very well to that extent. There's no need for two words. Let's meet the yellow player who showed what fighting spirit is. Announcer Kim Se-yeon. Yes, let's meet Jung Kwan-jang's yellow player.

1313
03:12:48.900 --> 03:12:54.300
It's really back to square one. Director Jeong's drama continues.

1314
03:12:54.300 --> 03:12:56.300
How do you feel about leading this victory?

1315
03:12:56.300 --> 03:13:00.100
First of all, in Daejeon

1316
03:13:00.100 --> 03:13:04.000
I promised that I wouldn't end it, but I'm so happy that I can keep that part

1317
03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:07.200
All the players worked so hard to win

1318
03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:11.700
All right. It's so cool to say that you keep your promise with your fans.

1319
03:13:11.700 --> 03:13:15.500
Yellow is running with a severe injury

1320
03:13:15.500 --> 03:13:18.400
That's right. How are you holding up every game?

1321
03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:21.300
To be honest, I'm enduring while managing my injury

1322
03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:24.500
There are other sick players besides me

1323
03:13:24.500 --> 03:13:28.400
Rather than fighting, as a whole team

1324
03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:31.500
I think this will come out because I worked hard

1325
03:13:31.500 --> 03:13:34.900
That's what I think. Yes, it's an answer that thinks of the team.

1326
03:13:34.900 --> 03:13:41.300
Yellow player's serve has been focused on Yellow player since the beginning

1327
03:13:41.300 --> 03:13:47.000
The share was too big. I'm curious how you overcame it. Honestly, I was a bit shaky today

1328
03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:50.100
I'm not satisfied with the game

1329
03:13:50.100 --> 03:13:54.200
I'll think about winning today and prepare better for the next game

1330
03:13:54.200 --> 03:13:56.700
I hope to see you in Incheon

1331
03:13:56.700 --> 03:13:58.800
Let's try to win.

1332
03:13:58.800 --> 03:14:01.300
Yes, the yellow player's experience of winning

1333
03:14:01.300 --> 03:14:07.100
But after the surgery, he came back and took the lead and won again

1334
03:14:07.100 --> 03:14:09.900
I think you'll have a different mindset. What do you think?

1335
03:14:09.900 --> 03:14:14.900
I think it's my first time trying this as the main character

1336
03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:20.200
I want to do it without any regrets and try to overcome it with my team members.

1337
03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:24.700
We're going to Incheon to keep our promise with our fans. Please tell us your resolution for the 5th game.

1338
03:14:24.700 --> 03:14:28.500
I didn't regret the 5th game

1339
03:14:28.500 --> 03:14:35.400
I want to make it so that I can laugh until the end. Yes, that's a great answer. Yellow player, congratulations again. Thank you.

1340
03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:38.500
We met Director Jeong's yellow player.

1341
03:14:38.500 --> 03:14:42.000
Yes, megawatti putty and yellow

1342
03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:47.200
Coach Ko Hee-jin and Jeong Kwan-jang's players made

1343
03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:50.700
It's a miraculous championship game

1344
03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:57.800
It's a series. That's right. It's the best championship ever. I think it's really safe to say that. Yes

1345
03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:00.500
The mental strength of the players of the fish team

1346
03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:03.500
I think it's a kind of mentality that you can only see in volleyball

1347
03:15:03.500 --> 03:15:07.900
Now, the game really goes back to Incheon. That's right. This is the last one

1348
03:15:07.900 --> 03:15:11.600
I'm expecting a game where I can't back down anymore.

1349
03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:16.600
You have to follow your mental strength and luck. Who will be the last champion

1350
03:15:16.600 --> 03:15:20.100
I'm also curious about who will raise the trophy.

1351
03:15:20.100 --> 03:15:23.400
This season's v-League women's championship series is

1352
03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:27.800
Now we're going back to Incheon, the origin. superhuman strength

1353
03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:41.300
You're watching a series where the mind controls the body. Commentator Cha Sang-hyun, thank you for your hard work on the news of Kim Se-yeon, announcer, and relief at the site reporting. Thank you for your efforts. I'm Yoon Seong-ho, the call caster. This is the V-League.
