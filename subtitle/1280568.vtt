00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:09.540
24-25 R4 PS vs HH | Nice to meet you, everyone. This is the 4th round match between women's Heungkuk Life Insurance and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction today in the Dodram 2024 2025 Brig of SBS Sports. I will send it to you with commentator Cha Sang-hyun from Incheon.

2
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.920
How are you? Yes, how are you? Yes, the Lunar New Year holiday begins today. a woman who marks the beginning of the holiday.

3
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.720
It's the best big match. Heungkuk Life and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's Heunghyunjeon is...

4
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.020
It's the best big match for women. Oh, that's right. Finally.

5
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.320
Today is here. If you're a volleyball fan, today's game...

6
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.420
I'm sure you've been waiting for a long time.

7
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.920
I'm looking forward to the game. That's right.

8
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.220
Currently, there is a three-point gap between Heungkuk Life Insurance and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.

9
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.320
Heungkuk Life lost 14 games in a row and it was a bit difficult.

10
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.920
I've recently won two games in a row.

11
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.520
It's been a while since I changed the flow. Right.

12
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.820
It was a bit difficult after the pitchman's injury.

13
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.920
We're going to reorganize the team again.

14
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:05.120
Matap has some ups and downs in each game, but I think he's adjusted to some extent. That's right. Heungkuk Life is getting ready to run away again.

15
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.220
To Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction,

16
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.920
There have been a few times. I had a few chances to catch up, but I was frustrated.

17
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.720
In the end, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has to lead this confrontation to victory.

18
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.020
You can look at the front. That's right. People say that today's game can be a six-point game.

19
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.020
In some cases, it's up to 6 points or even a tie.

20
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.020
It's that situation, but we have to wait and see.

21
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.420
That's right. Let's see if Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction will reduce the point gap.

22
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.920
It's a big match that I'm looking forward to seeing if I can get to the front.

23
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.620
Actually, not only the two teams, but Chung has narrowed the gap to 12 consecutive wins.

24
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.220
It was formed into a three-way structure. Right, the best 3 teams are in place.

25
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:57.620
Depending on how the game goes today, it's a matter of whether you can afford one or two games or if you continue to play under pressure.

26
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.520
So I think I'm more interested in today's game.

27
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.120
If Heungkuk Life loses today, it will be able to keep the lead position because there are many wins.

28
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.320
Will it happen here?

29
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.460
Whether Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction narrows down, it is a story that will inevitably draw considerable attention to today's economy.

30
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760
It's a 3.6-point game.

31
00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.660
The two teams that are preparing for today's game will get 3 points.

32
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:28.060
If you win, the gap could be eliminated. If you win, it could be up to 6 points.

33
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.560
The dynamic example is at a crossroads. That's right. As I said before, the point management...

34
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.560
It's a very important time.

35
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.860
Depending on the result of today's game,

36
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.360
It became a situation where I was chased or whether I could chase or not. That's right.

37
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.560
Compared to other games,

38
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.760
There's bound to be a bit more nervous.

39
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.560
I don't think so. Let's see which team will get this point today.

40
00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:01.860
The schedule for the fourth round is January 30th after today's match in Heungkuk Life. Next Thursday, I'm going to meet the articles of association.

41
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.360
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction will hold a match against GS Caltex on the 29th, the day of next week's Lunar New Year.

42
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.860
This is the end of the 4th round.

43
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.660
I don't think I need to explain more about Chung's momentum.

44
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:22.560
GS has also become scary recently, so I think both teams will be really important in finishing this fourth round. That's right. Coincidentally, considering the team's recent mood and performance, Jeong Kwan-jang is the best right now.

45
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.260
GS Caltex has had a hard time for a while,

46
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.560
For the first time this season, the atmosphere is completely up now with two consecutive wins. Yes, I have to prepare that.

47
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.460
This is Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. Heungkuk Life is also the first match of the 5th round in Gyeonggi Province.

48
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.260
Today, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction and Chung will play the best against the leading Mercury.

49
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.260
That's right. It's a schedule that can be a challenge. It could be the biggest challenge. Yes.

50
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.760
Let's see how many points we've won in these three games.

51
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.360
We'll see if we can secure it, and we'll see if it's possible.

52
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.560
A green light for the lead.

53
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.960
It may continue or a little yellow light may come on. Round 12 for this season's showdown.

54
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.160
Heungkuk Life won 3 to 1.

55
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.860
In the third round, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction took another 3-0 first out victory. That's right. First of all, 3.

56
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.560
The results came out until the round, but coincidentally, it's going the same way as last season.

57
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.360
Heungkuk Life won the 12th round last season.

58
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.660
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction won the third round.

59
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.960
I'm also curious about the results today. That's right.

60
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.460
Heungkuk Life won the 125th round last season.

61
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.360
3

62
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.660
That's right. Let's see what the 4th round is like.

63
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.360
I'm not sure if the two teams are going to play.

64
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.860
I remember it was always hot because we had a match.

65
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.360
Matteiko will come in and play 5 games today.

66
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.860
Prior to the IBK, he scored 12 points and had a 30.3% attack success rate.

67
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.260
From the third set, it didn't come out as a starting.

68
00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:03.760
That's right. With Matteiko out, Heungkuk Life's performance was better.

69
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.560
There was a situation, and I think one round...

70
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.360
I'm a matake player who hasn't finished yet.

71
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:20.660
I think we need a little more time. That's right. I think it's still an opportunity to adjust to the situation. We talked about it, but they said it's early.

72
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.260
I hope that the player will show 100% of his skills.

73
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.660
I think I'll be waiting for Korean life. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is really sad about the last game.

74
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.060
We lost in the 5th set against Jeong.

75
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:40.460
Especially, what was overturned in this set was a really incredible flow. Right. It was a set that I really didn't want to remember. Even when I saw it,

76
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.260
I didn't think so, but the game ended up losing in the second set.

77
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.960
I got one point,

78
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.560
It was a good chance to get 3 points. It was such a bummer.

79
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.660
We were ahead 24 to 19 in the second set.

80
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.260
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction can win today without difficulty.

81
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.760
It was that kind of trend, but Jeong Kwan-jang turned it upside down there and made a great victory.

82
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.660
Director Kang Seok-young has a lot of worries between Jung Ji-yoon and Ko Hyerim.

83
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:15.460
Considering the overall sense of receiving and stability, Ko Hye-rim is right. But Jung Ji-hoon is definitely strong in attack and blocking height.

84
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:22.360
There's a stomach. That's right. Whether to pressure the opponent or make our team play more smoothly.

85
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.960
He's the biggest director, Kang Sung-hyun. Yes.

86
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:31.860
In the end, we're going to have to pull out the strengths of the two outs together as much as possible. Yes, of course. Yes.

87
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.560
Let's check the starting list in a little while to see which player will come in first today.

88
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.560
Two veterans representing the Korean volleyball league.

89
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.960
It's a face-to-face match between players. Kim Hyun Kyung and

90
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.460
HYOJIN, you're doing great this season.

91
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.860
Right. First of all, the leader of both teams, Kim Hyunkyung and Hyojin.

92
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.060
He is seen as a big player, and today, Kim Hyun-kyung will see how successful the attack will be.

93
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.960
Yang Hyo-jin said how successful Kim Yeon-koung was.

94
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.020
It's a battle between a spear and a shield. That's right.

95
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:11.800
Announcer Kim Se-yeon met before the head coach match between Heungkuk Life Insurance and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. Let's check out the interview.

96
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:30.200
Let's meet the director of Heungkuk Life Insurance. The team is back on the winning streak. It's a very important time to continue the atmosphere. What did you prepare for the rest of the day ahead of today's game?

97
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:54.520
Yes, you also expressed a little regret about your performance. Actually, it's not a long time now, but you watched four games with Matteiko. How are you going to use Matteiko in the future? Way to go!

98
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:15.460
Yes, and we have a very important match against Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction today. In order not to be disappointed, what do you think the players must show in today's game?

99
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:43.900
Yes, we look forward to a great game today. Thank you.

100
00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:58.980
We met the director of Heungkuk Life Insurance. Let's meet director Kang Sung-hyun of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. We fought well until the end, but unfortunately, we lost, so I think you would have left some lingering feelings.

101
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:11.240
What did you talk a lot about to the players after this? Well, the result was one point in the second set. Of course, we'll have to win that and see what's next until the end, but it was a bit disappointing at the end. But...

102
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:26.140
What I'm saying to the players after that day is that I hope the result will be won and 100% satisfied, but I think I talked a lot about the game. I'm in the fourth round of this season, but I'm in the fourth round.

103
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:38.280
He complimented us that our performance was so good that we could count it in our fingers. In fact, I showed that Wi-Fi also came back to life, and there were definitely some positive factors.

104
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:51.820
I'm going to make the team better in the future. Have you got your bearings? So, the physical burden is increasing. You have to carry MOA with you. But it's a teamwork game.

105
00:10:52.020 --> 00:11:05.400
I think it's a direction where everyone gets through it together. Volleyball, I think the overall team work is important now how much you will improve your skills. Yes, and we have an important game with 6 points today.

106
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:15.180
What kind of lineup are you drawing today? It's our first match against foreign Matteiko players. I think we should keep an eye on that.

107
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:28.140
Moma is under a lot of pressure on the offense side, and I think the middle and outside side should help a lot. Yes, yes. We look forward to a great game today. Oh, thank you.

108
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.560
We met the director of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Kang Sung-hyun.

109
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:41.700
We've even heard the stories of director Agon and director Kang Sung-hyun. It's going to be the biggest watershed in the fight for first place.

110
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:50.560
Heungkuk Life Insurance and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's fourth Heunghyun exhibition of the season will start in earnest in a little while. This is Samsan World Gymnasium in Incheon.

111
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.680
Join us in the UNHCR emergency relief fundraising.

112
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.080
Now Ukrainian refugees are suffering from a severe winter.

113
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.780
Many refugee children are exposed to hypothermia pneumonia.

114
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.580
a warm place and blanket for children

115
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.800
I need emergency relief.

116
00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.000
Please help me now.

117
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.520
The refugees who barely survived the bombing...

118
00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.040
Survival is threatened again by winter.

119
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.100
You can get them for 10,000 won per month.

120
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.040
1

121
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.880
The U.N. refugee agency is doing its best on the ground.

122
00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.660
But with your help,

123
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.400
More lives could be saved.

Call 1899 5775 now to help families of refugees who have to endure the harsh winter.

125
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:06.200
Yes, it's Samsan World Gymnasium in Incheon again. Singer Hyorin came out at the first pitch of the game today.

126
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:16.340
Last season, he threw the first pitch here in Incheon during the opening game, and Heungkuk Life won again that day, so he came back with good energy. That's right.

127
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:29.720
In fact, he continues to cheer for Heungkuk Life. There are so many celebrities and sports fans these days.

128
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:43.160
He's turning it over. It's not easy to turn the net over. It's not easy. I'm not confident either. It looks like it. Yes, today, Heungkuk Life Insurance and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's

129
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:49.940
It's a starting lineup. Heungkuk Life is in front of Kim Soo-ji from the 1st place. Jung Yoon-ju, Peach Lee Bo-eun, Kim Hyun-kyung, and Shin Hyun-kyung from Libero.

130
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.440
From No. 1 spot, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Co., Ltd. has Yang Hyo-jin as the mother of Wipawi.

Today's referee Kang Joo-hee, referee Na Byung-soo, referee, Lee Myung-hee, and referee Jung Yoo-yeon.

134
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:30.380
If you look at it from a different perspective today, Jung Ji-hoon and Matake's performance is very important. Yes.

135
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:41.040
If Matteiko plays with Kim Hyun-kyung, the overall balance will be better. Literally, the triangular formation is completed. Yes.

136
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:52.480
Currently, Jung Ji-hoon came into the fourth round, so his record actually fell a little. It fell a lot. As I said before, Jung Ji-hoon's performance from the beginning is really important. Yes.

137
00:14:52.960 --> 00:15:03.380
Now, let's start the first set match between the two teams. Heungkuk Life's first server, Kim Su-ji, was shaken by the reception. Body Out.

138
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:13.040
Your Blocking Lee Bo-eun Back Course Matteiko Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction also had Kim Yeon-gyeon, who blocked effectively. Oh, my blue.

139
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:22.820
Heungkuk Life Insurance is off to a good start, and the first breaking is shown with Peach's hands. That's right.

140
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:33.160
Now, it's quite meaningful that we blocked Roma's attacks. It's a pitch that gained a head start as soon as it started.

141
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:41.720
This time, as Jung Ji-yoon approaches, she drops consecutive hits. BoA

142
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:54.960
The ball to Mohan fell a little lower than I thought, so the timing wasn't exactly right now, but he scored. Yes.

143
00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.840
A lot of spectators came today, and each goal is very important.

144
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:16.620
It's out. Yang Hyo-jin's serve mistake. The first mistake and the second one after 20 points are the most important.

145
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:26.100
In particular, today could be an important situation. Yes, Matteiko, serve low.

146
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.260
a time difference player

147
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:43.920
Oh, first of all, as I scored, I slightly bumped into Lee Go-hoon, but first of all, there's nothing wrong, and Jung Ji-hoon didn't wait for the long side in the beginning, so I've already prepared to go in that short. Yes.

148
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:56.620
Oh, it's pushed back. It's the second time I've made a sub-fault of Roman law, and it's definitely true that I have to try hard first. Yes.

149
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:10.660
Following Yang Hyo-jin, Momado's law of serve came out. Jung Yoon-joo's serve was sharp. a direct book

150
00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:11.760
Kim Hyunkyun's dig.

151
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:25.920
Roma calmly blocking no one covered. Now, rather than a strong ball, I put it in the conti and thought about the next thing. I'm getting broken again.

152
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:36.660
I like the pitch that caught the second mobile attack. All right.

153
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:42.680
Jung Ji-yoon hits Kim Hyun-kyung and Rishi with Kim Da-in under. Jung Hyunjoo picked it up.

154
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.780
I couldn't attack it and passed it.

155
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:55.140
Kim Hyun-kyun, Kim Da-in time difference, Jung Ji-yoon, has received Wi-Fi again. It doesn't fit well in the front of the body.

156
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.520
Shin Hyun-kyung's ball, Kim Hyun-kyung. Pushing.

157
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.440
I saved it and handed it over. The rally continues.

158
00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.520
Science and engineering is a high success. Kim Hyun-kyu

159
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:19.740
After scoring, Kim Hyun-kyung asked the science and engineering center to put it a little more inward. Yes. The first time I hit Pushing, the defense hit back, and the second one fell a little less than Kim Hyun-kyung wanted.

160
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.700
5

161
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:40.800
We keep doing that, but if we cover it without ending it at once, but if we put the connecting part a little more inward, we just have to go with more detail. If you don't finish it at once anyway, you should connect it to the second and third.

162
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:48.560
And just now, Yeonkyung was down on TV. Hurry up and watch it and come out.

163
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.680
I was going to move a lot in the beginning, but I was going to.

164
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.160
The two teams may be in a similar situation, but yes.

165
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.360
In order for Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction to do well today,

166
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.560
Moma's performance is very important.

167
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:14.160
Oma played in the second round against Heungkuk Life Insurance and now fell out due to injury, and in the last third round, he scored 11 points while playing in the third set.

168
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.060
We recorded a 42.3% attack success rate.

169
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.460
My shoulders are quite heavy. All right.

170
00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.860
in front of one's body

171
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.060
This is out.

172
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:30.360
I'm not sure. When we start making mistakes,

173
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:36.160
In fact, it's not easy to relieve the life of Heungkuk from Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.

174
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.960
There are some toss mistakes of Kim Dine Centa right now. Yes.

175
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.860
6

176
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:58.820
Take this pie well, and I'll go back to Moma. Yes, I'm going to pierce it this time. So to a certain extent, the ball that suits Moma's taste should come up and become a mistake, but eventually, Moma is also a human being.

177
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:12.220
There are definitely ups and downs and conditions of this emotion. Yes, it's a very important part. I'm out. Jung Ji-yoon's serve mistake is the third consecutive serve mistake. That's right. That's how much...

178
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:26.540
I think it can be said that Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is nervous. Yes, Hyojin and Rome Jung Jihoon. Sub by Bumchi Kitch.

179
00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.460
a serve score

180
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:39.760
First of all, Heungkuk Life is taking the lead with Peach's breaking and serve in the beginning. Heungkuk Life is ahead by 8 to 3. This is Incheon.

181
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:49.120
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture. The Appearance of Real Furniture that You Can't Tell Only by Touching

182
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.960
The real furniture of people who know something.

183
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.700
Hypers

184
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:26.660
Now, Peach is creating a very good atmosphere for the team, from the first two blocking points to the serve points. That's right. In Heungkuk Life, if you get two blocks from Moma,

185
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:38.180
There's nothing bad about it. Yes, in that state, if you go to the rear and make a serve ace, Heungkuk Life will become more comfortable today. Heungkuk Life is leading by 8 to 35 points in the first set.

186
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:47.920
Once again, Kim Hyung-kyun, a sub of the stroke, picked it up. Off to the left, two-way successful.

187
00:21:49.060 --> 00:22:00.560
I'm not sure right now. There's a little bit of shaking in receptions, but Kim Dine Center's accuracy at the beginning of the first set is falling a lot right now. Yes.

188
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:09.700
There's not a lot of accurate attack attempts right now. That's right. Hyundai E&amp;C was the first to serve on Lee Da-yeon's serve. Kim Hyun-kyu

189
00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:24.940
First of all, Igu Center knows for sure that there is a Kim Dine Center on the previous side. Yes, if Kim Hyun-kyung is in an avant-garde, the accuracy of the ball raised like this may be the best. Right.

190
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.280
I got the RBI right. Kim Hyun-kyung's Score

191
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:37.340
Lee Goeun sub Kim Da-in, Baekgeo team Roma.

192
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.620
It's going to the right. Way to go!

193
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.080
I saved it. Goma passed it. Matteiko.

194
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.540
Lee Veterans' Choice Vaccine Ho Matco's Score

195
00:22:49.300 --> 00:23:03.340
It's his first score, and Matake clearly looks nervous on his face. Yes, it's the most pressure and most important game he's played in Korean volleyball. Right.

196
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:14.300
You have to overcome this. You have to be able to enjoy the tension to become a good player. Sure. High Open Wipawi

197
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:27.600
It's completely gone. I don't know. There are so many mistakes that I can't see right now about the connection. Director Kang Sung-hyun of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is calling the time out one more time.

198
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:39.840
There's no sewing or connection. Let's not think about big things and try small things.

199
00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:52.460
That serve comes fast, right? Ha-yeon drew it from the front, and when it didn't work, I told her to connect it from the side, so it would be nice to connect it from the side if the under-ear becomes difficult. Ji

200
00:23:52.540 --> 00:24:06.820
If the receiving is shaken, it's inevitable if the opponent's serve intensity is strong, but in a way, the connection is a situation where you have to make your own connection. Yes.

201
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:19.880
Now that those parts are shaking, there is little to play right now. That's right. You must have prepared a lot for today's game, but the basic things that you prepared are not working right now. Right.

202
00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.720
Public sentiment is shaking. The attack didn't work again.

203
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.160
Heungkuk Life Chance Ball Kim Hyunkyu

204
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.260
I pressed it. Now.

205
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.060
Lipawi passed it.

206
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.500
This time, I'll give Kim Hyun-kyung a white one again.

207
00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:51.880
I don't know. Is it because I was too nervous? Or there is no breakthrough right now, but in the end, Ko Hye-rim comes in. That's right. So right now...

208
00:24:51.960 --> 00:25:02.480
If you evaluate it coldly, the science and engineering student is not going exactly right now, but yes, it is Kim Hyun-kyung who is making a score right now. I just fell down after scoring. Right.

209
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:16.080
Let's move on to Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's reception with Oh Hye-rim. I saved the net fight for now. On the left, there was a chance to attack Heungkuk Life again. Backtos Matteiko

210
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:30.160
My cheeks are out. There is a big gap in the score of this mistake, but it will be very disappointing. This is Korea Life's first mistake in today's game. They're saying it's okay. Yes.

211
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.300
Director Amondaza made a hand gesture that seemed to tell him to calm down a little.

212
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.660
Kim Da-in sub Jung Yoon-joo received it well and Kim Hyun-kyung from the right side of Etos.

213
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.020
Ko Ye-rim's defense is attached. I pierced Yutai.

214
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:58.600
First of all, it was a relatively easy goal when Ko Hye-rim came in, but she took stability in defense and made a score in the first fightback. Yes.

215
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:04.540
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction needs this situation now.

216
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.560
Kim Hyunkyung, RishiBi's attack.

217
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:26.740
It pierces perfectly. It should be considered that Lee Bo-eun's one-handed toss was very accurate, and Kim Yeon-koung can't miss this. That's right. It completely beat Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's blocking. Oh, it looked so good on you.

218
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:35.660
13

219
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.580
Shin Young-ryong got it. Jung Eun-joo.

220
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:50.700
It goes into the line. Currently, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's offensive teamwork is not exactly right until 14:6. Yes.

221
00:26:51.200 --> 00:27:03.140
The carrot's fastball became a bit awkward. In the end, Jung Yun-ju's counterattack Jung Yun-ju also scored his first goal. Oh.

222
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.280
Are you going to save me? Failed to save. a sub-subservant

223
00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:18.060
The first set is too difficult for Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. Kim Hyun-kyung's serve ace will also explode. I'm not sure. I'm sure it's relativity, but yes.

224
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:25.460
In fact, this wasn't what we expected. Unexpectedly, this is the first set of one-sided flow. One more time, Kim Hyunkyung's serve.

225
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.360
Monner is on the left.

226
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.440
I put it in. Anyway...

227
00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:44.540
Yes, I have to solve it. It doesn't end with just one set, but isn't it Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction that has overcome a lot of these crises? Yes, we lost the last game, but we still secured one point and depending on whether we played today or not.

228
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.640
You can even get first place.

229
00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.740
I received Wi-Fi's sub Shin Hyun-kyung.

230
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.440
I stabbed it in the empty space of the central pipe, but Mom touched it.

231
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.600
Ko Ye-rim's counterattack is a success.

232
00:27:54.780 --> 00:28:07.280
Now, maybe if Ko Ye-rim takes a little stability only in today's performance attack, in fact, there is definitely a sense of stability in Missive and defense than Jung Ji-hoon.

233
00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.820
I looked at the positions of the blockers and turned them in a straight line.

234
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.660
Cosmateiko scored as Jung Hyun-joon fell to veterans' bases.

235
00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:27.800
The problem is this. Now, Matake's offense depends on whether Jung Ji-hoon is in front or not. Heungkuk Life is leading by 16 to 88 points. This is Incheon.

236
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.160
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture.

237
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:56.160
The real furniture that you can tell by touching it. Real furniture by people who know something.

238
00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.860
Hypers

239
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:11.440
Before today's game, coach Kang Sung-hyun also said that the reason why Jung Ji-yoon is starting is because Matteiko's height is a little conscious now.

240
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:23.680
Right. Since we're the first team, it's hard to release Matteiko too much. That's what I'm thinking. Yes, Kim Hyun-kyung is already 5 points ahead, and she's got serve points.

241
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:37.740
As expected, Kim Yeon-kyung is leading the flow well from the beginning. I'm scared of Kim Hyun-kyung, but they say she's cute. It's scary and really scary inside the coat. He's so good to our fans.

242
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:45.640
Kim Su-ji's serve, Oma long, went inside the fusic. First of all, it's 16 to 88 points.

243
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:59.620
It's fortunate that the player is being released little by little. Yes, I poked it deep toward seat 5.

244
00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:05.880
Yang Hyojin's sub Shim Hyunkyung.

245
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:13.500
I got Jung Hyun-joo. Wipawi caught up. Kim Dahee turning it high.

246
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:26.660
Lee Gong-eun once again fought back against Yang Hyo-jin's dig and Moma Yang Hyo-jin, who made two digs. Now, the counterattack might be a bit disappointing. Now, Moma's formula is a bit disappointing.

247
00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:39.080
The reason why Ko Ye-rim went in is that this heretical connection has come up exactly right now. I rolled it up well with a pulse point, but it didn't exactly hit the line. I think so. I'm out of it a lot.

248
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.580
I got a matteiko sub, Ko Yerim.

249
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.180
Kim Hyunbyun following me.

250
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.680
Heungkuk Life Insurance Takes Chance to Fight Back

251
00:30:54.740 --> 00:31:01.200
For sure, a pitch player is very stable when he moves and has power on the ball. Yes.

252
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:15.100
At the beginning of the first set of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, I couldn't use my strength. Peach player's first offensive score

253
00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:23.800
I'm out. That's a relief. Matteiko's rule of serve was a target that could bring the atmosphere completely, but it was slightly pushed back.

254
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:37.840
Do Soo-bin is putting in the matteiko position. First of all, director Avnanza looks quite relaxed right now. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is being prepared by Na Young-soo. I went in instead of Kim Dine.

255
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:48.540
a sub kid

256
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:56.320
You get caught in the net. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is also the seventh of its kind. There are so many. Yes.

257
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:06.220
First of all, the fact that Kim Sa-young has entered the center seems to think that he needs a break to reinforce the three former players. Yes.

258
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:17.360
I'm giving Moba a break. JEONGYEONJU's serve ace.

259
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.540
Jung Hyunjin is attacking Jeonhee well.

260
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:27.640
Since he serves so well, the score gap must have widened. I hit him with ease.

261
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.940
That's right. Jung Yunjoo is the No. 1 sub in the team.

262
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.540
Among all domestic players, it is second only to Yeomhae-seon.

263
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.540
The serve score came out from the first set again today. Okay, I shook it again.

264
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.020
Na Yeon raised it high and Ko Yerin hit back-to-back.

265
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.840
Let's move on to Kim Hyun-kyung right away. I turned it on.

266
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:54.460
When you look at these situations, you can't help but think that Kim Yeon-koung is really good at volleyball. Yes.

267
00:32:54.540 --> 00:33:09.480
He's instantly aware of the opponent's coat. That's right. You need to know the location of the net. There's definitely the essence of touch. Yes, it's Kim Hyun-kyung who knows exactly that. This one to ten.

268
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:20.220
I put it in the middle of Na Yeon-soo's attack. First of all, there needs to be a situation where someone can change the atmosphere of the first set. as of now

269
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:30.140
Recently, there is a big temperature difference in each set of Hyundai E&amp;C. Right.

270
00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.360
Again, light movement attack, Park Chi-Ae.

271
00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:46.980
I already felt like I was going to score from the moment I jumped. Yes, the rhythm of a mobile attack is actually very important. That's right. When a pitch player makes a mobile attack, he likes the Daegaseon.

272
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.320
I was aiming for a straight line. That's right.

273
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:59.460
I got Go Hyerim as Peach's sub. It's long. Na Yeonsoo covers the empty space.

274
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.820
2

275
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:12.660
Now, the attack doesn't work. Lee Da-hyun's left Hwigal revived the WeTaWi. DO SOOBIN's 2nd level Kim Won Kyu.

276
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.840
Then, we got a block.

277
00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:30.040
Again, the four upper waves on the left are successful. First of all, Wi-Fi player also scored an attack point, but overall, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is not doing well in the team. Yes, because of that, Heungkuk Life...

278
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:44.660
After the injury, maybe Uttuk thought it was a chance today, but the first set looks a little hard. The connection itself is not working smoothly right now. Kim Hyun-kyung, exact 20th Kim Bum-pyo.

279
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.520
It's a sharp one.

280
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:53.860
If you hit the ball like this, there's no way to defend. Yes. It's a perfect chemistry.

281
00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:08.900
There was a WeFabby player who couldn't stop this even though he knew something, but that's inevitable. Yang Hyo-jin has already moved. Yes. Matteiko came back in and served.

282
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:14.580
The reception went well. Lee Seok-gu, Shin Hyun-kyung's Dig Matteiko

283
00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:15.920
Blocking bound

284
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:24.260
Kim Sa-rang, shoot to the left. In the first-place diagonal, Kim Hyun-kyung's ninth-ranked Jung Hyun-joo and Kim Hyun-kyung followed.

285
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:34.800
Na Young saved the right block. It was hard to cover the hotel. Again, Heungkuk Life's chance ball fastball scored by Kim Soo-ji.

286
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.400
I can see how relaxed Kim Soojin is.

287
00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:50.860
I've seen a lot of people scratching like this in Abay's fastball. Yes, since I have that space, I have to make it long in the back, and now it's the same even if I look at it through a strong ball. It's a pattern that doesn't come out that much.

288
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.600
That's how much you can afford. 24/12 Double Score Set Home

289
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:03.440
Yang Hyo-jin's quick attack. Yes, it's falling. Even now, Yang Hyo-jin's cheeks were quite long.

290
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:17.540
There is also a feeling that Jung Yoon touched the ball that goes out a little bit.

291
00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:23.260
Na Hyun-soo's serve is long off. The first set is over due to a mistake. 25 to 13

292
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:25.600
The first set is a complete victory for Heungkuk Life.

293
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:33.200
I'm not sure. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's economy is not going well enough to think that there was such a difficult history. First of all, the second generation.

294
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.600
I think we need to prepare well. Yes, Heungkuk Life won the first set by 12 points.

295
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.100
We'll be back in a little while.

296
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:44.560
This is Samsan World Gymnasium in Incheon.

297
00:36:51.880 --> 00:37:06.840
Why do you know that a dodram is the first place? Experts who keep the freshness, find the best taste, and match their tastes. The first meister who makes a dodram. A dodram of taste that I like. A dodram of money.

298
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.800
Why did I choose?

299
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.060
with a variety of plans and special discounts.

300
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:21.500
Wow, the compensation is as reliable as Gangwon-do, so remember one thing. Hana Direct Automobile Insurance.

301
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:34.820
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture. The real furniture that you can tell by touching it. Real furniture by people who know something.

302
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.500
Hypers

303
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:49.120
Made in Korea People Who Become Symbols Of Innovation The World Has Changed But it's the corporate enterprise that's changed the world. A great company that never stops in Korea.

304
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.820
IBK Industrial Bank next to it.

305
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:14.180
You're so pretty today, too. The donation plan shows my heart.

306
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:22.020
From the fruit of love this winter, the fruit of love makes the world look handsome.

307
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:33.200
The women's team is currently facing Heungkuk Life Insurance, the 1st place, and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, the 2nd place, in the 4th round. The first set is...

308
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.600
It's a very one-sided flow.

309
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.600
Life has won. The records are all indicators right now.

310
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.700
He's ahead. Right, breaking serve is 8 to 2.

311
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.300
If there are eight mistakes in a set, you can do it.

312
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.700
There's very little you can do. Right.

313
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:54.600
The receiving efficiency is 62.5% for Heungkuk Life Insurance, so it should be considered that Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction was not able to shake it at all.

314
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:59.500
On the other hand, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction had a hard time starting from receiving.

315
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:06.100
There were not many good attacks. Yes, there were certain parts where the reception was shaky, but even the connection...

316
00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:15.000
It didn't go well and gave up the first set too easily. Kim Hyunkyung has the most...

317
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:22.200
Heungkuk Life was able to easily solve the first set as it scored seven points and Fitch added another five points.

318
00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.000
Go Hyerim came out as a starter. In the end, I feel a sense of stability.

319
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.580
Director Kang Sung-hyun, who decided it was necessary. Yes.

320
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:45.140
Yes, the stomach wave is gone and Jung Ji-yoon and Ko Ye-rim have prepared the 2nd set of starts. That's right. It's an intention to change the atmosphere, and if one of the four players doesn't make it, Wipawi will definitely come back in. That's right.

321
00:39:45.220 --> 00:40:00.060
Now, someone is Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, who has to run and raise the atmosphere. It started with Kim Da-in's serve in the second set of both teams. I uploaded Jung Yoon Ju's receiving while sitting down. I'll take it.

322
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.420
After the defense, Lee succeeded in hitting back fastball digs.

323
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:15.180
It's Jung Yoon-joo's "I-Tachi Out Sloak Out." It's true that Lee Go-eun is the best among the setters when it comes to defending one spot over there. Oh, yeah.

324
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:26.820
Even now, Yang Hae-jin stabbed him in a surprise move, but there is a high possibility that he would have eaten it if it were for other players. Yes, it was Lee Gon's defense that flew his body reflexively. So if you score like this, the atmosphere can't help but go up.

325
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:32.960
Jung Yoon-joo solved the big attack again.

326
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.940
Kim Su-ji's serve is against Bum-sik.

327
00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:49.820
You have to be careful about serve mistakes in the beginning of Heungkuk Life. Of course. In the first set, only Nateiko made 2 mistakes.

328
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:56.300
Yang Hyo-ji, who drops the cu-chi in the center, check it out first.

329
00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:02.740
The video review director requested it.

330
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:11.140
Since it hit Yang Yu-jin's hand and it was the next situation, I asked for a video review of this ball location exactly on the Internet.

331
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:19.520
Yang Hyo-jin touched Peach's attack once and then it was an attack motion. That's right.

332
00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.640
HYOJIN poked the ball with his left hand.

333
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.620
As a result of the reading, it was identified as a blocker overnet. Yes, that’s right.

334
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.040
I got hit once by HYOJIN's hand.

335
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.940
It was important whether the position of the ball was Heungkuk Life or Hyundai, but the ball had already crossed over. That's right.

336
00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.140
Yang Hyo-jin's 5th sword room.

337
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:12.040
Matteiko's Mistakes

338
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.240
I said that I need to be careful about my serve mistakes.

339
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:18.900
Hyundai E&amp;C felt like this at the start of the first set.

340
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:27.120
Kim Soo-ji's Matake Two consecutive sub mistakes came out.

341
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:34.120
2

342
00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:48.820
In the end, it's about what to do next when this reception is shaken, but I'm checking it again now. Director Avon Danza has also requested a video review. It's a similar situation now. I think I'll watch it through NetTouch.

343
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:59.620
Heungkuk Life Team has requested a video review of the four touches. Yes, you asked for a touch review.

344
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:21.140
Lee Da-hyun scored by sweeping quickly, and I don't know if he touched the net in the process.

345
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.720
Let's.

346
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:39.480
As a result of the reading, it was confirmed that it was not four touches. Yes, yes. It wasn't a touch. First of all, we have to accept it, and we have to set the mood well in the beginning. Heungkuk Life Example

347
00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:53.520
I got a short serve, Jung Yoon-joo. Undertoss Beach prepared for a move attack, but the exact ball couldn't come. I can't keep up with Rome's attack.

348
00:43:53.600 --> 00:44:08.560
Heungkuk Life, who solved the first set well, is a little cluttered at the beginning of the second set without knowing something. Yes, the rebound is still very good.

349
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:14.160
Kitch checked the ball a little late and this veteran almost collided a little bit as he rushed in.

350
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:24.800
Yang Hyo-jin's serve didn't go over. First of all, the target was good. Jung Yu-jin was moving on the lapft side, so we did well to attack, but we're sorry for the mistake. Yes.

351
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:34.540
Jeong Yunju.

352
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.080
Step on it again and open it to the inside of your body.

353
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:55.120
Blue key The player's breaking sense is quite good today. I'm short, but yes.

354
00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:02.700
Since he has such a jumping ability, the RBI in his hand at the end is slightly higher than Kim Yeon-koung. I think so.

355
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.600
Oh, it's moving on? Direct Kim Hyun-kyun defends. Moma circle

356
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:21.220
You're out. Let's check out the Roman legend, Kang Sung-hyun. Request for video review of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction

357
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:35.620
The fully modern consulting team on the video number 2 seat side requested a video review of the in-out. It was a ball that went completely to the corner. It was the longest side. Yes.

358
00:45:50.500 --> 00:46:03.380
It was confirmed to be phosphorus as a result of the reading. It's In. You did a really important reading. It was an attack that came right into the vertex. In a way, it can't go any longer than that. All right.

359
00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.020
MOMA RECOVERED SCORE BY READING

360
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:21.000
It's out of serve. He seems to be in a bit of a hurry, but first of all, it's urgent to say that the toss is a little low. Yes. The toss he wanted didn't go well.

361
00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:30.180
Roma's mistakes are already being recorded for the fifth time today. It's a lot of mistakes. Yes.

362
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.780
For sure, Ko Ye-rim already has a sense of stability in two shots. All right.

363
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:55.920
The posture is quite good. He said his shoulder was a little uncomfortable in the last game, but he said his condition improved a lot today. Ko Hye-rim and Jung Ji-hoon showed really good performance after the injury.

364
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:05.760
Kim Hyun-kyung received it and Kim Hyun-kyung, the defendant's paint mother, held it. I'll hit Jung Jiyoon. I woke up again, but Jeong Hyeon-joo took it up, but it grew out.

365
00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:20.800
The location was quite good, but Jung Ji-yoon's RBI and ball speed were so good. Yes. Jung Jiyoon who overcame it with strength.

366
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.120
The score is 7 to 5 again. Go Hyerim serves.

367
00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:27.580
It's Kim Hyunkyung's touch on the left.

368
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:42.780
Oh, it's fast. First of all, it's fast and high, so there's a lot of pressure for Kim Da-in center to catch with this blocking. That's right. In the end, we need to catch him through defense, but since he's so wide in angle, Kim Hyung-geun is...

369
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:49.520
I've come to the defense position on the reliable side. Yes. Kim Hyunkyung scored 8 points.

370
00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.080
A large number of sub-momas aiming for Jung Ji-yoon's side.

371
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:55.800
Shin Hyun-kyung's Dig

372
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.400
You're hitting me. That's right. Yes.

373
00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:09.280
First of all, I hit the ball quite a lot and hit four strokes, but it was a very good attack. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is leading by 8 to 6 in the second set. This is Incheon.

374
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:14.460
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture.

375
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:22.560
The appearance of real furniture that can only be touched. The real furniture of people who know something.

376
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.260
Hypers

377
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:53.960
In the second set, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is reducing its mistakes and increasing its attack success rate. First, technical.

378
00:48:54.040 --> 00:49:07.500
8

379
00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:15.020
In the second set, each team has three mistakes.

380
00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:18.060
8

381
00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:29.800
Kim Hyun-kyung got it and left Matteiko Oh, good. After Rome's defense, I handed it over for now. Heungkuk Life's Attack Matteiko Again

382
00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:42.580
Lee Guwon Center has chosen two consecutive toucha, and yes, if you look at the attack itself, it was quite strong. That's right.

383
00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:57.140
Now Matteiko was able to take advantage of height, right? He basically just reaches out and gets on the net. Yes, Kim Hyun-kyung's serve was added a lot.

384
00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.780
Salim Kim Dyne Open Jung Jiwoo.

385
00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:05.300
Shin Hyun-kyung received it neatly. I like Jung Eunjoo's left-hand opening.

386
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:20.700
So Jung Yoon-ji is definitely confident in this swing, so she just hits it right away without stopping in the middle of the game. That's right. It has a refreshing taste. You have to hit the attack like that. Yes.

387
00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:28.560
It went very strongly into the straight line. 8 to 8 east

388
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.400
The reception didn't go well.

389
00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:43.360
It's too close. Jung Yoon-joo's re-movement, which drops the empty space, actually, the players have to move a little and play a cover, but I'm watching it too much. Yes.

390
00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.660
Heungkuk Life has turned the tables. nine to eight

391
00:50:46.760 --> 00:51:00.200
Director Kang Sung Young, who is singing "Time Out".

392
00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:14.900
It's high, but JI HOON doesn't have to bite in the middle. Hurry up.

393
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:25.420
We can't win if we can't laugh. You have to do it with that Sprite. When I'm receiving,

394
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:39.580
The first thing is to send the setter without moving, but even to a certain location, it's not a crime. I can play well, so I have to think about that.

395
00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:47.340
I wish I could get ready for the second moves faster when I put it up as a two-stage connection. Kim Hyun-kyung serves three times in a row.

396
00:51:47.980 --> 00:52:00.600
Kim Dine Backtos Ma Touch Arts If you go to that position where Jung Ji-hoon just played 20 b, you can actually play as a team. Yes.

397
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:13.460
A really perfect reception doesn't come out very often. That's right. That could be more burdensome for receivers. Yes, if you receive a certain amount of reception, you can continue playing.

398
00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.220
I hit Kim Da-in's sub-net and moved on. It's my first time at Evo Peebuck.

399
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:32.740
You can say that Jeong In-joo's 20V position is almost the same. So the Bigon setter moves about a foot or two, but if you look at the situation when you play, you'll see a masonry. Let's hit him on the move. It's enough to do it. Yes.

400
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:47.200
A very neat pattern came out. Sunru Kim Suzy Kim Dahee Lunder Toss to the left, Homa.

401
00:52:47.280 --> 00:53:00.740
I got an out point well, but I was out. Well, the pitch player turned around as if he had been hit, so we have to check. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction requests a video review. If it hit the hands of the pitch player, the expression was read.

402
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:09.820
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction team requested a video review of the blocker touchout. Oh, I raised my hand that the beach player was hit.

403
00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:19.580
All right.

404
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.800
It's confirmed.

405
00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:34.660
As a result of the reading, it was confirmed as touch out. That's right. If lawmaker Cha Sang-hyun recognized it just by looking at his face, he would have caught enough on the bench of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. First of all,

406
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:40.520
In the middle, Peach gave an autograph to referee Kang Joo-hee. Yes, yes.

407
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:46.160
Kim Dae-shin's equalizer Kitch's attack was stabbed in the civilian space.

408
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:56.120
If you can't move your defense to this kind of attack, it's a form of defense of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction that has no choice but to expand its space.

409
00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:10.740
Now, we need to move a little more. Now it was almost a false paint. Because I didn't get the timing, Peach attacked with initiality. Go Hyerim's two-tiered hair.

410
00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:25.740
Touch out on the straight side. So you can see the importance of the two-stage connection by looking at this ball that Ko Ye-rim just posted. Anyway, the disposition was shaky, but it even creates a pattern where Moma can attack accurately. Yes.

411
00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:31.280
This is to help the invisible volleyball. This is enough for MOMA to go on a free course.

412
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.700
I can choose and hit you.

413
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:38.500
Yang Hyojin's sub Songak Park is ready.

414
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:52.660
Kim Dine's left-hand open Oyeri is in. King is Heungkuk Life Insurance, which adds one breaking, and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction needs a score battle. I think he was still a pitch player. Let's take a look.

415
00:54:52.740 --> 00:55:07.440
I got it on my right hand. If you taste it once, you catch a lot of pitch players. Jeong Hyeon-joo, the 4th pitch today, blocked point, sharp serve.

416
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.320
I saved it for now.

417
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:13.100
in this case

418
00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:27.240
Now, the mobile attack is falling in the civilian space. So in a way, it's exciting in the blocking, so you can see the other's coat more widely. Yes, the steps of the moving attack are quite cheerful.

419
00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:33.980
Peach player is continuing. So these paints actually make sense. He tries to attack so hard.

420
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.260
13

421
00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:44.020
Kim Hyun-kyun, Lee Si-seok, touch out, Lee Da-hyun, Lee Da-hyun is also in the tip of the masonry. Yes.

422
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:58.520
Now, it seems that we need to increase our market share a little more. It's my first fastball score of the day. Lee Da-hyun, player No-ma.

423
00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.140
Two-ball Jump Outs, Kim Hyun-kyung.

424
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:17.020
I hit it with a river that I can't defend. I told you earlier that it's an attack that you can't stop even if you know it in the first set, but there's another similar course. Even now, Lee Da-yeon has completely moved to mark Kim Hyung-kyu.

425
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:26.620
It creates a bigger river than that. It's a possible attack because it's Kim Hyun-kyung. 14 to 12 receiving was very shaky.

426
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.340
Another chance for Heungkuk Life.

427
00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:33.840
Kim Hyun-kyung pioneered the Kaint.

428
00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.180
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is getting too much paint. Yes.

429
00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:52.040
It's very strong. That's right, Kim Hyun-kyung. That's how the balance of modern coats is shaking a lot right now. That's right.

430
00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:04.080
Go Hye-rim and Kim Hyun-kyung germinate to the left of Jeong Ji-hoon's receiving. Jung Yoon-joo in the center rear position is caught. I moved on for now.

431
00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:16.220
You have requested an interim rally read. If Jung Hyun-joo didn't hit the broker's hand when he tried to attack the rear, it would be a poi-poy.

432
00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:28.560
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction team requested a video review of the points. Let's see if there was a blocker touch when Jung Hyun-joo attacked.

433
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:38.440
All right.

434
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:58.180
I'm paying attention to Lee Da-hyun's right arm now. The reading confirmed that it is not a point.

435
00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:10.940
Because of Lee Da-yeon's touch, she's really good at holding the camera band. Now, this one point was eventually taken by Korean life. Heungkuk Life leads by 16 to 124 points. This is Incheon.

436
00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:31.520
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture.

437
00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:39.780
The real furniture that you can tell by touching it. Real furniture by people who know something.

438
00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:41.520
Hypers

439
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:55.080
Since it was the middle of the rally, the player appeals to the referee that it didn't hit him.

440
00:58:55.160 --> 00:59:09.600
It also resulted in deceiving our side a little bit. However, in a way, if you judge it coldly, the ball was already about to be dead, so even if this reading failed, the score was likely to go toward Heungkuk.

441
00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:16.480
Non-Powie players have been deployed. Finally, we're done with organizing. Home party.

442
00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.400
Left Kick Off

443
00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:34.120
It's Peach's defense and he shot me with strength. Kim Hyun-kyung's Attack Kim Hyun-kyu Hyun Dig Kim Da-in Backtos Moma

444
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.500
I saved it. Kim Hyunkyung.

445
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.300
You have no choice but to go to the right. Matrico

446
00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:43.400
Again, Kim Hyun-kyun's dig rally gets longer. Go Yeri

447
00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:51.160
It's out. I didn't get hit and left. I really hit as much as I wanted, but it's a mistake again. Yes.

448
00:59:51.240 --> 01:00:06.000
The reason why Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is playing a little hard is because the success rate is not coming out from the left. Yes, yes.

449
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.840
Quitch serve four times in a row.

450
01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:15.520
The reception went well. Kim Su-ji succeeded in defending this time.

451
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:25.280
It's a ball that went over. Hyundai's Kim Hyun-kyung is running. I didn't go under the toss properly. Take out the front part of your body and start picking.

452
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:34.800
It's been a long time since I tried processing, and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is having a lot of difficulties in connection. Yes.

453
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:42.040
In the first set, Momado had a 36% attack success rate, but it came up a lot in the second set.

454
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.380
Hong Yerim's serve.

455
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.100
a hole-in-the-hole matteiko

456
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.820
Kim Young-kyun's League

457
01:00:51.320 --> 01:01:03.620
It fell a lot. Moma will hit you. It came and went down. Moma Moma also encourages the players after scoring, maybe because it's very frustrating. Moma's back-to-back points cut the gap by three points. Heungkuk Life's Time Out

458
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:33.340
Coach Abondaji is pushing our operation microphone and talking to Lee Go-hoon one-on-one. I want to say something in secret. When I was a director,

459
01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:46.600
There were many times when I analyzed what the directors were talking about after the operation time and planned the operation based on it. I think the director is a little worried about those things.

460
01:01:46.680 --> 01:02:01.280
Actually, it's a little over the top, but if Kang Dong-wook can do that, there's definitely something I can understand. Yes, but the reaction that's a little annoying isn't good to see. Right. In a better way, yes.

461
01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:15.860
It's leading to Go Yerim's serve. Kim Hyun-kyung, I stepped on the left side, but I'm out. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is chasing by 2 points.

462
01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:25.640
The director shouldn't get excited. Our microphone is set up to follow the director when it's time to operate.

463
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:39.720
It's like that. Yes. Heungkuk Life Insurance, which is beating the chase with Kim Hyun-kyung's score, can actually be uncomfortable for those who watch 18-15. Yes.

464
01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.600
Kim Hyun-kyung was way up.

465
01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.500
Wippa Irish Quick Open Spike Front.

466
01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:01.640
In the end, coach Kang Se-young's biggest concern is that when Mi-Fi and Ko Hye-rim go in, there is definitely a sense of defensive stability, but yes.

467
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:16.360
There are times when there are a little question marks to find the way out of the attack, but the attack was quite good now. That's right. I took it out sharply between number 4 and number 5. Shin Hyun-kyung was shaken by Lee Da-hyun's serve. Kim Hyunkyung who followed and saved him.

468
01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:23.080
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's Chasing Opportunity Kim Da-in's Choice a Quick Attack. I followed him this time.

469
01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:32.560
The rally continues. Another chance ball. This time, Moma's backup Tex defense succeeded, Heungkuk Life's counterattack.

470
01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:38.060
It's not easy to pierce. Back to Wipawi. Yes, it's the front.

471
01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:50.740
Now, the Wipain player is setting the tone. Yes, how you score after scoring is very important, but fighting is also very important right now for Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. It's a one-point difference.

472
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:57.240
Since Matteiko's success rate did not come out, Kim Daeun came in in the end.

473
01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:03.340
Matteiko's attack success rate is currently a little low by 23%.

474
01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.080
Kim Hyun-kyung hit me with it. That side.

475
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:22.520
Yang Hyo-jin was a little hesitant right now, but Kim Da-won just came in and it was okay to throw a winning move when Kim Yeon-koung was on the right side, but she hung on a little. Yes.

476
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:30.280
Kim Hyunkyung and Seo Eun.

477
01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:43.020
This pie is well received. Yang Hyo-jin's fastball, Kim Hyun-kyung's defense. Again, Yang Hyo-jin beat Kim Hyun-kyung to the long side of the No. 5 spot, and then hit the No. 1 spot very long. All right.

478
01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:51.680
As the defense leaned over there, the number one spot was completely empty. That's right. I read the empty seats perfectly. Yes.

479
01:04:55.900 --> 01:05:05.900
Kim Da-in's serve center tarif hit Kim Hyun-kyung's Nice Degg 1 par 1 served with a fist.

480
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:09.060
Shin Hyunkyung, left 2nd rank Choi Minjoo.

481
01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:24.280
Kim Hyun-kyung's Libero fell completely into the corner expecting him to hit it long, but he broke it again to make a Crew. That's right. That's great. Kyungminseon is amazing.

482
01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:37.520
Kim Min-soo is now adding skill to the attack. Now it's definitely Kim Hyung-kyun's diagonal. Yes, Kim Soojin and sub Kim Hyungkyun followed. The first ball.

483
01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.200
Touch.

484
01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:43.480
Now, Kim Da-hee's center suits you very well. Yes.

485
01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:54.860
HYOJIN didn't score much today.

486
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:59.740
We need to save more to change the flow of this game. Sure.

487
01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:06.000
on the sub-witter

488
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.360
The U.S. put it up with a hard time. Kim Daun.

489
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.360
Dig high on this wave. High.

490
01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.060
Shin Hyun-kyung's iced tea. I caught it with Jung Hyun-jin's shot. Yes.

491
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:29.500
No. I already knew that Hyundai E&amp;C players would put it on, but they're dropping it to a position where it's really hard to defend. Yes, I knew it and played a forward defense. Right.

492
01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:38.000
From here, you get a score as you fall into a very difficult position. Jung Yoon-joong, who is making his opponent tricky,

493
01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:53.040
If Kim Ta and Kim Da-won sometimes come in and help the serve ace like this, Heungkuk Life will go up further. Yes, the serve ace exploded at a crucial moment. I hope you follow Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's time-out.

494
01:06:53.120 --> 01:07:07.940
That's why Rome also blocks inside. Clear it towards the line. But if you hit it, there's a libero. Right, you hit it for a long time, or you hit it for more snaps.

495
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:20.940
If you don't think you're going to use Seojin because both sides are small, you can go from B to Light or A to that hot side.

496
01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:29.820
First of all, one side out is very important for Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.

497
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:43.720
From Heungkuk Life Insurance's point of view, when Matake leaves the team, Kim Dae-eun always comes in. If you look at the team's play and the atmosphere, the atmosphere is better when he leaves the team. Yes.

498
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.880
At the same time, we won a lot of games. Right.

499
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:56.680
In a way, it can be said that Heungkuk Life is a bit of a dilemma right now. Yes, I put Kim Dine high. Mona.

500
01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:06.020
Kim Hyun-kyung, neat defense Lee Go-eun, and Jung Yoon-joo to the left. The referee is asking for a review.

501
01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.140
Video review requested by referee Kang Joo-hee

502
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:19.500
I've already decided to push you, but I'll have to see your results. The referee has requested a video review of the blocker touchout.

503
01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:29.240
Oh yes.

504
01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:43.400
It was Yang Hyo-jin and Moma's high block, but that's why I pushed it. That's right. As a result, it was confirmed as no touch. Yes, but it's a little off. Yes, I pushed too much. Yes, but the attempt was very good. That's right.

505
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:51.360
Han Mi-re is getting ready to put in.

506
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:05.640
While Heungkuk Life has four serve points today, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has not come out yet. It's a very important serve. Yes.

507
01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:17.800
Han Mi-ri's serve net hit and moved on. Peach's got it. Move it in. Tack.

508
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:28.720
The perfect mobile attack you receive is a strong attack that can be called the standard of mobile attack in a way. That's right.

509
01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:42.720
So while you're receiving it, you can do enough movement attacks like that. Yes, 23 to 20 Jung Yunju's serve.

510
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.540
I put Kim Dyne on it. MOA.

511
01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:57.680
Peach. Today is Peach day. I've caught four Moma attacks right now. To the point where Kim Hyun-kyung and Peach said they caught each other,

512
01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.200
Oh, my.

513
01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:13.860
I think Peach caught it now. That's right. Let's give each other autographs. It's a pitch of 5 blocking points. First of all, I got a serve. Jung Yoon Soo, but whenever Jung Yoon Soo hits a serve,

514
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.220
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is facing a crisis. Yes.

515
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:22.140
Go Soo-bin has entered the position of Jeong Hyeon-ju.

516
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.880
Three-point set point Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction also reinforced the height by putting in Na Yeon-soo.

517
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.520
The serve is Moma.

518
01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:41.380
Do Soo-bin's receiving ball is pushed to the left here.

519
01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.640
It's out.

520
01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:48.520
I think I'll do a video review.

521
01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:52.560
Well, first of all,

522
01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:03.540
The very difficult Heungkuk Life Team requested a video review of the blocker touchout. If it's touch out, this set is over.

523
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:25.160
Lee Da-yeon's right-hand reading confirmed it as a touch out. It's a little shaky. With Kim Hyun-kyung's score, Heungkuk Life also brought the second set. First of all, Heungkuk Life is doing so well.

524
01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:38.340
The pitch player's performance is quite outstanding in the second set as well. That's right. Heungkuk Life is now leading the set score 2-0. We'll be back in a little while. This is Samsan World Gymnasium in Incheon.

525
01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:58.800
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture. The real furniture that you can tell by touching it. Real furniture by people who know something.

526
01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.480
Hypers

527
01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:30.020
The reason we found a new material is that the amount of spam is the same regardless of whether you hit it once or 100 times. trap the amount of spam unique to Altge Cleveland in G-alloy.

528
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:43.560
Cleveland, do you know why Dodram Han Don is number one? Experts who preserve freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes make Dodram Handon, the No. 1 Meister.

529
01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:58.140
The Made in Korea, which has become a symbol of favorite flavor innovation, has changed the world. But it's the corporate enterprise that's changed the world. A great company that never stops in Korea.

530
01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.880
IBK Industrial Bank next to it.

531
01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:16.100
No, I'm a little bloated. It's not to that extent. Let's not endure that much pain and bloating and eat tangerine force at once. Tangerine posel.

532
01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.260
a cup of coffee

533
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:34.460
I'll donate. Why would you give me a cup of coffee or a fruit of love to make me look good in the world this winter? Do you think money comes first?

534
01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:46.180
Experts who preserve freshness, find the best taste, and match all tastes. 1st place to make a lot of money. 1st place to make a lot of money. 1st place to make a lot of delicious food.

535
01:13:51.260 --> 01:14:06.160
Today's match, which will be the biggest watershed for the No. 1 fight. As expected, the stadium is full of volleyball fans, and more than ever, cheering is unfolding with a hotter shout. In fact, Heungkuk Life's overwhelming flow from the first set.

536
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:15.020
I'm ahead of you. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction had to play a very difficult game by pouring out Bum from the beginning of the game. From the second set, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction...

537
01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:17.300
I didn't give up and chased him until the end, but...

538
01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:22.200
At a critical moment, Jung Yoon-joo and his coach started to play.

539
01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.900
In the end, Heungkuk Life also won the second set.

540
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.100
Today's game is a game.

541
01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:30.100
The tension between the players of both teams.

542
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.100
I can feel it well. And for today's game,

543
01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:40.700
In particular, singer Hyorin, Kim Yeon-kyung's best friend, is performing a special performance above. I hope you'll stay with us for a short time.

544
01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:46.300
Let's watch it. Hyorim's special performance.

545
01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.400
Oh, I'll listen to it for a moment.

546
01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:40.620
You're completely turning this Daegu stadium into a concert hall. Yes, I wanted to go down a lot while doing this, but I was scolded for holding it in.

547
01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:52.760
If you dance, you can dance, but no. You have to hold it in for now. It's hard. I see. Heungkuk Life won both the first and second sets of the fourth round showdown between Heungkuk Life and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.

548
01:15:52.840 --> 01:16:07.740
In the second set, Heungkuk Life had a 50% attack success rate and three blocking points and one serve point, while Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction still has zero blocking and serving points until the second set. It's a tough game right now. Especially,

549
01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:18.620
Although today's mobile attack is similar to the breaking of Peach players, it seems to have more weight today. Yes.

550
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:34.840
Heungkuk Life has Kim Yeon-koung scoring 13 points and Peach scoring 11 points, including 5 blocking points, while Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has 11 points for Moma, 5 points for Wipawi, and 3 points for Yang Hyo-jin.

551
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:44.820
The support of the dot seems to be somewhat low. That's right. It's quite a shame that Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction doesn't have the number of breaking. That's right.

552
01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:50.060
Now, let's start with Kim Soo-ji's serve in the 3rd set of both teams.

553
01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.800
Kim Da-in became a back-to-back offensive defense with two par-outs.

554
01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.500
Hit Jeong Hyeon-ju.

555
01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.940
Ready to fight back after the digs, Wipawi opens.

556
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.680
Kim Dahyun saved it. HYOJIN, go to the left.

557
01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.360
Kim Hyun-kyung as the central rear of Hanseong Dig Kim Su-ji.

558
01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:26.720
Now, certainly Heungkuk Life has Kim Yeon-koung and Chung Hyun who can give up points, while Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is running quite difficult right now. Yes, if Moma doesn't solve it, I can't see the answer well.

559
01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.940
That's right.

560
01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.460
It was Kim Yeon-koung's first back attack score today.

561
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.160
Kim Hyun Gyun succeeded at 2 o'clock, Kim Soo Jin, and Tink.

562
01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.560
It's the farm job at the entrance of the mart on the right.

563
01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:49.860
If Matteiko joins the scoring team, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction will have a harder time. Yes.

564
01:17:49.940 --> 01:18:04.000
Today's game is a game of 1st place and 12th place and a game of a lot of interest, but it's going a little unilaterally.

565
01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:18.380
It's completely shaken by the lease. Wi-Fi is hitting me. It's going in. Thank God. Even if it's hard to go, Wi-Fi was in fairly good condition in the previous game. Yes, we need to save more.

566
01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:28.060
The first set is Jung Ji-hoon's Wipawi, the second set is Jung Ji-yoon and Ko Hye-rim, and the third set is Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction, which continues to change the combination of the upper leg heater.

567
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:35.840
Are we moving on to the sub on Yupa? Ahyang Hyojin's over and over when this veteran catches him.

568
01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:47.300
First of all, the center of interest was able to set it up now as it settled down, so if you touched it, it would be Obanet, but it's director Kang Sung-hyun who checks it first.

569
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:52.500
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction team requested a video review of Overnet.

570
01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:22.080
Yang Hyojin's over net when Lee Geohoon sets things up.

571
01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.700
Video reading for this scene

572
01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:39.860
Let's zoom in a little bit.

573
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:57.200
If your hand hasn't gone over, it's Obanet. Lee Kwang Hoon's position is very important.

574
01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.340
Should I zoom in a little bit?

575
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:41.700
We're listening to Round Round for the third time. Video review that takes a long time

576
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:58.620
The results aren't ready yet. As a result of reading, it has been determined to be unreadable.

577
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:10.720
Since it has been decided to be unreadable, the original trial will remain in Yang Hyo-jin's No. 5. The readers made it unreadable, so we have to accept it.

578
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.900
I don't know. I think it's right that there's a little question mark from the perspective of director Kang Sung-hyun. Yes.

579
01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:21.540
If there was a screen closer to the other screen, I would have accepted it.

580
01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.380
The screen is...

581
01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:37.420
It's because it wasn't clear, so we concluded that it was illegible. First of all, the original trial is maintained, and director Kang Sung-hyung is in a situation where one video review is alive. That's right. We'll continue with the score of 3 to 1.

582
01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:42.660
Kim Hyung-kyun picked it up, but it was shaken a lot. Put your hands on the side of the oma.

583
01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:49.300
Shin Hyun-kyung puts it on and Jeong In-gyu hits it. Blutaa, you're really good at pushing and hitting. Yeah.

584
01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:57.280
So, since Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction cannot be broken today, it feels like Heungkuk Life's attack power has been revived.

585
01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:09.740
The strikers are trying without burden. That's right. First of all, there is Jung Yoon-joo who is helping Kim Hyun-kyung whenever there is a chance. I moved on. Kim Da-in received his first ball.

586
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:10.820
Get together.

587
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.060
Today, Beach continues to block Moma's attacks.

588
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:33.400
At this rate, MOA will dream of a pitch tonight. Yeah, both directors of Time Out, Kang Sung Hyung,

589
01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:44.400
There's no other way. If you do this, that's why you put heretics.

590
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:58.980
Go high and if it's over there, make it low and put it on. Yes, push and hit. If you're holding it with someone else, overdo it and go all the way.

591
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.300
It's so frustrating.

592
01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:07.100
If we finish with today's game,

593
01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:11.300
It's a situation where we have to admit it, but we have to prepare for the 5th round.

594
01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:20.040
We have to prepare for the 6th round and from Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's point of view, we have to prepare for the volleyball we just saw. That's right. That's why it's so frustrating.

595
01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:24.960
In the end, someone has to run.

596
01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:28.220
Kim Dyne Jump Toss Cho Yerim, back-to-back hits.

597
01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.220
I defended myself. Jeong Injoo, open to the left.

598
01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:33.140
Is it touch out?

599
01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:40.620
The judge who didn't get it right is reading it again. Avonza director requesting video review

600
01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.500
I promise.

601
01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:52.340
JAMOMA almost requested a video review of the blocker touchout from the Heungkuk Life team.

602
01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.540
Ah.

603
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:18.340
The reading confirmed that it was touch-out. Now again, Rep. Cha Sang-hyun saw Moma's expression and read it to some extent. Yes, by the way, from Heungkuk Life Insurance's point of view, the game is going well.

604
01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:26.140
Today, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is not working well enough to think that it might not be able to use its power properly. 6 to 15 points.

605
01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.760
Kang Hyo-jin, Jung Yoon-joo succeeded in the league with one hand of Kim Da-in.

606
01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:35.300
Kim Hyunkyun, empty space in the backup tag field. Nice league.

607
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.940
Yang Hyo-jin passed high. Jung In-kyu hits Heungkuk Life's chance ball to the left again. Your blocking

608
01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.160
The connection is important. Rome Kim Hyun-kyung succeeded in the dig

609
01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.100
Again, YUNJOO's kick.

610
01:24:52.980 --> 01:25:07.700
I can't stop Jung Yoon-joon. He's really good at hitting. The success rate of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's attack can't help but come out like this, but even if it doesn't come out, it's not coming out well.

611
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:16.200
Jung Yoon-joo scored using Jamoma's blocking hand. 5 consecutive serve matteico

612
01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:26.760
This poem is done, and Go Ye-rim can't be pierced to the left. Again, Jung Yoon-ju, spike, rookie, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's first blocking score.

613
01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:33.940
Even if you come in, the atmosphere of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is not reviving at all. All right.

614
01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:42.640
I got caught in the little one's right hand. The game is not over yet. Of course. The beginning of the third set.

615
01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:46.060
Yang Hyojin serve.

616
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:58.620
Do I follow you? It's touch out. I can't catch it. With the score of four pitches, Heungkuk Life is leading the third set with eight to two. This is Incheon.

617
01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:03.780
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture.

618
01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:11.980
The real furniture that you can tell by touching it. Real furniture by people who know something.

619
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:13.720
Hypers

620
01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:41.980
Heungkuk Life is leading 6 to 1 today, and Peach caught all 6 blocks.

621
01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:57.020
Five of them were Moma's attacks. That's right. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction's game didn't go well, but there were a lot of situations where the pitch player completely broke the mood when he caught the most important player, Moma.

622
01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:12.060
In the end, it's about catching or drilling, but so far, the pitch player has won the fight. That's right. At the same time, Moma's attack success rate today is down to 30%. That's right. Jung Hyunjoo's serve.

623
01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:24.980
It hit the head of Ettos Norma Shin Hyun-kyung and got out. I don't know if it's to keep the flow away, but I got hit in the head and I just woke up. Yes.

624
01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:33.420
It's going to hurt, but there's going to be a momentary shock.

625
01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.440
Short serve is shaking.

626
01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:38.120
I'm handing it over.

627
01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:48.300
Kim Da-in and Ko Ye-rim's streak is falling on the Wi-Fi. He scores, but the atmosphere on the court of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is not alive. Yes.

628
01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:57.360
It doesn't go into the air exactly, but you can see a lot of things that seem like you're forcing it over.

629
01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.880
I definitely have anxiety.

630
01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:17.480
Can you be this strong? Ko Hye-rim is also chasing hard, but it's really not easy to stop her. So, I use the expression that I'm not conscious, but I'm not conscious of Peach's attack today.

631
01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:22.380
Fourteen points. The pitch I scored today.

632
01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:26.560
There was also one serve ace.

633
01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:31.080
Failed to pass.

634
01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.460
I really need to stop. Yes, this is my first mistake. Beach player, today's example.

635
01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:39.660
Kim Yeon-koung and Kim Yeon-koung are tied for 14 points right now. Yes, ma'am.

636
01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:42.160
That's how good he is. Yes.

637
01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:46.880
The attack success rate is now 78% Pixu.

638
01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.180
Open to the left. Gimhae attack.

639
01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.200
Moma closed it.

640
01:28:52.440 --> 01:29:01.360
The netwatch was pointed out.

641
01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:15.380
It must be a very frustrating situation for the viewers, but in fact, the players who are playing on the court must be very frustrated. Lee Da-hyun could not avoid the net.

642
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:24.180
On the left, Lee Pa-wi and Lee Go-eun took it up with one hand. Jung Yoon-ju's Connection Kim Hyun-kyung Short Paint

643
01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.180
It's alive.

644
01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:37.780
Lee did not fit Kim Hyun-kyung well again this time. 3rd stage of the ball that bounced back over par.

645
01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:43.280
Kim Suzy's part is ready again. The Eagle of Go Ye-rim

646
01:29:44.020 --> 01:29:46.480
I put it on. Wippawi Blue Car

647
01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:57.460
It's Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction that scores during the most reel rally, and I hope this will bring back the atmosphere. Yes.

648
01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:07.300
Weepayu scores using a high Matteiko's block.

649
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.880
Sigourke Matico

650
01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:27.620
The three sets are definitely better compared to the work set. Yes, would it have been a little stimulating as he was replaced by Kim Da-won in the middle?

651
01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:41.480
I also gave him an RBI. Even if you support Kim Hyun-kyung and Chung Hyun-joo this much, Matteiko will play a sufficient role. That's right. 11:6 Kim Hyun-kyung sub. Kim Hyun-kyung got it. Shameless.

652
01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.620
Lee Kun-hoon's good defense.

653
01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:45.500
Jeon Min-ju's counterattack

654
01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.540
Ko Hye-rim is waiting in the background.

655
01:30:50.620 --> 01:31:02.940
Kim Soo-ji and Kim Soo-ji are also participating in the breaking. Yes, it's the first breaking since Peach. Right.

656
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.680
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has a Soohyun Lee player in it.

657
01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:17.580
Lee Soo-yeon and Na Yeon-soo are being put in. I'm trying to change the mood. Your new face.

658
01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:20.760
I put it in again.

659
01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:34.460
I'm a Soohyun Lee center from Chung-Ang Girls' High School, who joined as the fourth in the second round. There was one replacement business trip before the Korea Expressway Corporation in the second round. I'm sure you'll be very nervous. Today is the second game.

660
01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:39.700
Lee Suyeon, a rookie setter born in 2006.

661
01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:52.720
Once you ask for a seat, the assistant referee can tell you where it is. You have to place the exact spot and then play.

662
01:31:52.800 --> 01:32:01.000
The Soohyun Lee went into the Kim Da-in position, and Na Yeon-soo's position was replaced as it was in the mother's position. That's right.

663
01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:10.900
Lee Suyeon's first setting.

664
01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:12.560
an attack on the waves

665
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:22.260
It's Kim Hyun-kyung's back attack. It's out of the way. We're behind on the offense. Yes, so right now...

666
01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:34.860
The previous three positions were not reinforced, but the setter was collected according to the setter, and Na Hyun changed it now, so the previous position is still going.

667
01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:43.140
It's out of the way. First, we need to get rid of the tension quickly. That's right.

668
01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:56.720
She is a Soohyun Lee player who was selected as the fourth in the second round in the draft from Jungang Girls' Middle School.

669
01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:00.600
I missed Kim Soo Jin's reception.

670
01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:04.400
Na Yeon-soo didn't open properly.

671
01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:15.780
Kim Soo-jin's connection Matteiko fight is going far away. Touchout Matteiko 3 sets sounds good. Yes.

672
01:33:17.100 --> 01:33:27.280
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction requested a timeout.

673
01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:38.800
Sub Lee Seung-gu, focus on your mole. Go into the show-in and try it. If it's hard to do a masonry, take it out like this.

674
01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:42.300
Go in again. Go in.

675
01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:52.840
If it's hard for Soohyun Lee Centa to succeed in playing,

676
01:33:52.920 --> 01:34:05.900
I'm telling you to play that way because there are Na Hyun-soo who can hit a big striker and Ko Hye-rim of Wi-Fi right now. Yes, I'm sure you'll be nervous. Of course. And how big is today's game?

677
01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:16.440
There's a 10,000-won crowd today. That's right. The heat of Samsan World Gymnasium is very hot, and I said something similar before, but you have to enjoy the tension well again. Of course. Yes.

678
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.060
This friend is doing well. League of left picker Kim Soo-ji

679
01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:40.700
Jung Yoon-kyu will hit you. The car came in. If Kim Soo-jin defends like that, Jung Yoon-joo should score. Right.

680
01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:46.520
The defense of this one-digit mini-blocker is very valuable. Oh, of course. Yes.

681
01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:52.460
Kim Suzy serves 3 times in a row.

682
01:34:52.900 --> 01:35:04.460
It's out. Yes, I tried to go deep, but it was pushed out, but the atmosphere on the court of Heungkuk Life is too bright. That's right.

683
01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:11.240
Rome lost in thought in the Warmock Zone

684
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:16.540
I got a serve on top of the stomach wave. It's over from the Direct garrison.

685
01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:30.240
It's a relief that the central dash of Soohyun Lee is the sentencing character of the light vehicle. I tried direct and almost scored, but I got hit by the foot and crossed it again. Right.

686
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:36.300
There's enough difference of 6 points. Way to go!

687
01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:38.860
I'm going.

688
01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.220
Jeong Yun-ju's receiving hits hard to the left.

689
01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:48.160
Jung Hyun-joo is really good at attacking Heungkuk Life today and it's hard to break down Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.

690
01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:55.500
Jeong Yoon-ju scored 13 points. 16-9 Heungkuk Life is leading the way. This is Incheon.

691
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:15.700
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture.

692
01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:20.140
The Appearance of Real Furniture that You Can't Tell Only by Touching

693
01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:23.980
The real furniture of people who know something.

694
01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.680
Hypers

695
01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:42.580
The 12th place team, which is being held in front of a crowd of 6050 people and 10,000 won today, is a showdown between the 12th place teams. 3 sets, 16 to 9.

696
01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.640
Korea Life's 7-point lead

697
01:36:45.920 --> 01:37:00.680
Pitch Kim Hyun-kyung scored 14 points each, and Jung Yoon-joo scored 13 points. That's right.

698
01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:14.480
Here we go. Matake Servais can get more points. Matake can also attack and serve more often. Yes.

699
01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:25.740
It's dripping at the end. That's right. The trajectory was pretty good.

700
01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:27.700
Go Yerim to the left.

701
01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:28.960
Let's.

702
01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:30.880
It's out.

703
01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.500
Do you check it out?

704
01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:43.980
Rather than the director Kang Sung Hyun who is requesting a video review,

705
01:37:44.200 --> 01:37:49.600
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction team requested a video review of the blocker touchout.

706
01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:07.920
It's on the left hand side of this veteran player.

707
01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:32.160
I think only Lee Ho-won can know about this. It's really fine.

708
01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.640
They're saying that the player didn't get hit.

709
01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:58.800
It's not easy to come to a conclusion. Well, this is a difficult reading, but I think the first screen is better than this one.

710
01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:14.220
The reading confirmed that it was touch-out. Yes, Lee Kun-wook is admitting it now. Nod your head. Your nose is going to get longer. But if it's like this right now, it's almost like a scratch on my fingernails.

711
01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:26.900
Since it's the season, I think my fingers are shaking a little at the end because it's a shadow, but since Lee Dong-hoon was doing so much, I also believed it a little, but yes, I'll have to talk after it's over.

712
01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:35.840
The result is touch out. It's Heungkuk Life Insurance with Cho Soo-bin.

713
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:45.600
Right now, it's Han Mi-ri's serve. Shin Hyun-kyung 20 movement attack is unstoppable. Is it possible to make a strong movement attack like this?

714
01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:46.740
It's really strong.

715
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:52.200
I think it's almost 100% successful today.

716
01:39:52.280 --> 01:40:03.980
I'm hitting hard enough to hear exclamations from the top, and my breathing is perfect right now. That's right. He scored 15 points.

717
01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:17.960
Jung Yoon-joo, who can't turn over the serve, is Jung Yoon-joo, who is in good condition, and he makes a mistake on the serve, but it seems good for me to keep trying hard. By all means.

718
01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:24.280
Moving attack again.

719
01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:38.200
Ko Hye-rim finally blocks it. It's my second block today. There was one Moma player, and now Ko Hye-rim catches one. That's right. Ko Hye-rim, who has been following the pitch hard, finally catches the block. There's a man-to-play.

720
01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:09.680
The set score is 2 to 0 and the gap in the 3rd set is 6 points.

721
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:16.840
It could be, but Amondaga believes that if the players relax now, the atmosphere may be over. Right.

722
01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:25.080
To prevent that in advance, I cut it off as a timeout.

723
01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:30.200
Ibo has postponed to the left. Kim Hyun-kyung's Fate is not here.

724
01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:36.380
Even if you put paint on it, it's definitely a little different than intensity.

725
01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:53.280
I'm reading it correctly. We all know this situation and play it. That's right. Yes, Peach's serve.

726
01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.380
Cho Hye-rim falls to the left. Pierce through and listen.

727
01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:12.120
First of all, Soohyun Lee continues to be on the court, and overall, he's raising it slowly without any major mistakes. Yes, I'm sure you're very nervous.

728
01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:15.580
Still, I play calmly.

729
01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.620
Go Yerim's serve, Kim Youngkyung. Tigo.

730
01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:35.900
I can't believe it. The center line to the attack line is 3M, and the fact that it fell in the center means that it has succeeded in attacking within 1.5 meters. How do I block this? This is...

731
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:44.880
I don't think I can catch it either. The angle is really big. That's great. Matteiko is back on the front. the service of veterans

732
01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.640
I'm going to the left. Wipawi Short Paint Oh Lee Go-hoon's defense

733
01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:52.620
Kim Hyun-kyung will hit you.

734
01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:56.060
Go Hyerim caught me from the back and tied again.

735
01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:11.220
I set it up perfectly, but there were Matteiko and Kim Su-ji in the front. It's very high. Let's look at Matteiko's blocking height. It's a long way up.

736
01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:15.700
Kim Soo-jin is not low, but then you can see one more palm on top of it.

737
01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.780
Except for the light, the touch of the text is out. Na Young-soo's score.

738
01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:35.060
First of all, Na Hyun-soo is scoring a point with a rear attack. Yes, I hit him confidently in a no-block situation.

739
01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:38.940
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction needs to move more actively.

740
01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.020
Backsir Dewer Blocking

741
01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:47.300
I pushed my Soohyun Lee to the left. I like the top pie. Scoring.

742
01:43:47.620 --> 01:44:02.540
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is trying to fight back after a long time. Yes, as I said earlier, today's game is also today, but we have 13 more games left to play. That's right. It looks like it needs to be repaired.

743
01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:16.200
The serve was long. I don't know about Lee Da-hyun's flow of mistakes. In fact, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has never been able to bring about the flow throughout today's game. Right.

744
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:24.820
There was one 8/6 situation in the second set, but I haven't been able to win since then. Kim Yeon-koung's serve.

745
01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:30.200
Lee Kun-hoon, a Soohyun Lee expletive, defended calmly. Matteiko is done.

746
01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:46.680
Maybe Matteiko will adjust a little faster in the future if she keeps taking it like this in the third set today. Yes.

747
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.160
I shook Rishi and I blocked an open luteer to the left.

748
01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:58.560
Lee Do Hoon setting. Jung Eun Ju on the left.

749
01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:13.500
Lee Go-eun is now setting up to completely beat the opponent's middle broker. That's right. Yang Hyo-jin is stuck. Yes, Heungkuk Life's match point. All the spectators have stood up.

750
01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:29.140
The Soohyun Lee saved Wipawi's attack to the left. It's a chance to finish it right away. Jung Yoon-joo pushed in first and Yang Hyo-jin's attack didn't work.

751
01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:34.120
I can definitely finish it. Finish with Kim Soo-ji's quick attack.

752
01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:47.580
First of all, Heungkuk Life Insurance has widened its gap with second place to six points by winning today's game, and now if Jeong Kwan-jang prepares well for the game, he may maintain the first place for the time being.

753
01:45:47.660 --> 01:46:00.060
Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders, who give fans a pleasant 3-0 shutdown victory as a Lunar New Year gift, beat No. 2 by 6 points.

754
01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:03.740
It's our first time out since we're in the second half of the year.

755
01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:06.940
Today, Seunggi and Abu Daza are...

756
01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:10.240
On January 30th, the director Jeong's game...

757
01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:15.040
You might think that it's a little easier.

758
01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:17.540
The problem is Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction.

759
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:20.040
Ah, I'm not sure. Every game...

760
01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.840
Every set has ups and downs. Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is very serious these days.

761
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:26.240
It looks like it's definitely in need of maintenance. That's right.

762
01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:30.140
Anyway, there was a period when Heungkuk Life was a bit shaky.

763
01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:32.840
We've won 3 games in a row.

764
01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:36.540
Now, let's play the real game with Director Jeong.

765
01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:39.140
I made it look forward to it. That's right.

766
01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.740
Up to the fourth round,

767
01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:50.240
Since there is a six-point difference, the first place will be decided by the fourth round. Jeong Kwan-jang's game, where Korean life is left,

768
01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:55.040
Depending on how you do it, do you have more time to prepare for the 5th round?

769
01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:00.840
It's going to be like being chased or something. Anyway, the top three teams...

770
01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.040
I'm aiming for the top spot in the regular league. That's right.

771
01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:10.840
The overall success rate of Heungkuk Life Insurance's attack has exceeded 50%, so this makes the game quite easy.

772
01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.740
It was easy. That's right. It was a situation that had to happen.

773
01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:17.340
Especially today, Peach's breaking...

774
01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.840
What kind of intensity of a mobile attack...

775
01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:26.540
It looked a lot stronger than other days. Yes, that's breaking.

776
01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:30.340
I caught Moma, the opponent's main striker.

777
01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:34.040
It has completely captured the atmosphere of Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. I think that's how you should look at it.

778
01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:44.340
That's right. I can't help but pick this player today. Peach player scored 15 points, served 1 point, blocked 6 points, attack success rate is 72 points.

779
01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:46.740
Seven percent. a great deal of anger

780
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:54.640
It means that the attack success rate is almost over 70%. That's right. That's how good the attack was today.

781
01:47:54.640 --> 01:48:01.340
He's a pitch player, but his blocking shone more. I think there was nothing I couldn't do today. Peach player attack

782
01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:08.540
He also played a strong role in blocking serve, leading the team to a 3-0 shutdown victory.

783
01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:22.620
Especially because we caught a lot of Roma players from the beginning. Yes. Today, Peach created a foothold that was able to bring the flow of the team well. I'm preparing for the interview with a very happy expression. Announcer Kim Se-hyun, please come out.

784
01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:33.020
Yes. Let's meet Heungkuk Life's Peach. He captured a very important game with a perfect performance. You look very excited right now. How do you feel?

785
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:42.380
I'm really happy to win.

786
01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:56.900
Yes, today's Peach player's performance was amazing. Did you get much more focused because it was an important game today? How was it?

787
01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:09.940
Yes, I think we tried to focus a little more than other games.

788
01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:25.160
I think I executed the things I planned well and came out with good results. Yes. In particular, I caught six Peach players today, and five of them were Moma's attacks. I'm also curious if a more thorough analysis has been done.

789
01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:48.420
I've been trying to focus on blocking since last week. I used to focus on blocking during training, but I feel like I got so many blocks.

790
01:49:48.500 --> 01:50:03.220
All right. Yes. I think the practice effort was revealed in today's game, but the ranking fight is getting fiercer and the team's crisis has come, but Heungkuk Life is still keeping the top spot. With what determination is Peach joining this championship race?

791
01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:30.700
Yes. It's about concentrating as much as possible during training and making sure that the things you've trained for come out of the actual game. To win the next game.

792
01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:44.920
I think that's the point. Yes, actually, today's game was sold out. The fans are very excited right now. Please say hello to the fans.

793
01:50:54.260 --> 01:51:02.780
Yes. It was a sold-out match, but I'm happy to win like this. I'm always happy to be able to play in front of our fans.

794
01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:17.820
Happy New Year and I hope we can see each other a lot in the next game. Yes, I didn't miss the Lunar New Year's greeting. Congratulations once again on your victory. Thank you.

795
01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:25.740
Yes, we met Heungkuk Life's Peach. Yes, I can't look so happy this time, Peach.

796
01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:29.020
Peach's bright energy is play, too.

797
01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:38.920
I think it has a very good influence on the team. That's right. In the end, you have to think that the facial expressions and positive behaviors have a good influence on the team.

798
01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:42.220
Now, a lot of fans might not even remember it.

799
01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:46.220
Actually, when I chose Woo Il-rae at first, yes, yes.

800
01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:49.620
I thought a big crisis came to Heungkuk Life.

801
01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:56.620
I believe that the atmosphere of Heungkuk Life has completely changed due to the arrival of Peach. It was a great choice.

802
01:51:56.620 --> 01:52:01.520
That's right. With Beach's great performance, Heungkuk Life won 3-0 today.

803
01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:06.520
Tomorrow, at the men's Jangchung Gymnasium, our card and KB will be held.

804
01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:14.220
I'm sending you a game of non-life insurance. Please watch the broadcast of commentator Lee Jae-yong Castor Song Byung-il tomorrow.

805
01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:19.320
With the news that Heungkuk Life had 3 points against Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction today,

806
01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:21.520
This is the end of the broadcast.

807
01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:26.120
This has been Cha Sang-hyun, commentator, and announcer Kim Se-yeon. I was castor Lee Junhyuk.

808
01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:29.640
Segu fans, have a happy holiday. Thank you.

01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:47.240
So that everyone can feel it, fly up, beautiful today is a good happy day
