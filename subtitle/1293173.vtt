R6 Red Sparks vs Pink Spiders (Adu tim lapis 2)

1
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:14.680
Dodnam, the 6th round of the women's league in the 2024-2025 season of the v-League, Jeong Kwan-jang, Red Sparks University Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders, the leading actor in the game of 1 win, KBS volleyball commentator in Korea, and

2
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:29.080
I will do it together. First of all, I'm worried about the home team's Jeong Kwan-jang and the injured players. First of all, we need to confirm the 2nd place, but Park Eun-jin and Bukirich are on the brakes due to the injury

3
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:43.860
But it's more advantageous to fix this. That's why the players who come in on behalf of these players should do their best until the end. Yes, I heard that the injury comes without notice, but right now, it's quite

4
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:58.500
I think we've lost a lot of momentum for the second place fight. So to focus on the playoffs, I think we need to prepare for the playoffs from today's game.

5
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:11.340
Except for spring, depending on how much Park Eun-hee and Bouquet recovered and what kind of performance they showed

6
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:26.940
I think it will be judged whether you can do it or not. So, we're going to do our best to focus on recovering. The fans of Heungkuk Life Insurance, the away team, are now

7
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:38.520
I'm suffering from a mental injury. After Kim Yeon-koung announced her retirement, fans are disappointed. I'm not sure. I'm sure the rest of the game is No. 1 in the regular league

8
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:51.640
There are still games left until the final championship, so fans must continue to accompany them.

9
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:34.640
This is the sold-out procession of Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon where the game was held today. After the announcement of Kim Yeon-kyung's retirement, all the matches of Heungkuk Life have been sold out

10
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:49.540
I think the fans are trying not to miss a single moment of disappointment. And this is Kim Yeonkyung's last regular league match A lot of people came to see us. Yes, today's key word is injury

11
00:03:49.620 --> 00:04:02.880
It's a game where you can predict rotation to a certain extent, but I hope to see players who are not injured and emerging in the process. This is Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon. I'll be back in a minute.

12
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.980
Sketchers comfort is powerful. I'm always ready

13
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:18.140
Sketchers hands-free sleeping bins with the power of comfort because you make me a person who continues to challenge for a long time

14
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:33.340
People who have eaten this gartan say. Differences in ingredients make a difference in effectiveness. Swelling and bleeding gum disease changes the gums with four components. I got a toothburn for gum disease.

15
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:43.540
Yes, it's Chungmu Gymnasium again. Dodram 2024-20029 Season V League Women's Round 6

16
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:52.160
It's currently Soon-ri. Heungkuk Life Insurance has confirmed the top spot in the regular league with 76 points. Chung has 58 points and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction 57 points. Fierce

17
00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:03.400
It's a battle for second place, but both teams have rarely secured points. First of all, I think the players' recovery is more important. Yes

18
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:13.440
Hyundai E&amp;C is currently in a three-game losing streak and Jeong Kwan-jang has played three games and is currently 1-2 games. Both teams played five games this season

19
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.620
Director Jung won only once. Round 3, December 17th

20
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.720
3

21
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.120
Heungkuk Life captured both games in a row.

22
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.320
Round 4 and 5, the last round. Round 5

23
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.320
With this victory in the first game, Heungkuk Life Insurance

24
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.320
He took the lead in the fight for first place. That's right.

25
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.220
It's Kim Yeon-koung. I'm 36 years old this year

26
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.520
I'm a little disappointed. Yes, thatâ€™s right. So, the skills

27
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.020
It's still so good that many fans are sad about Kim Yeon-koung's retirement

28
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.020
I have no choice but to do it. Yes, it's really at the top. It's like the quick open and the attack part, too

29
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.320
It's always been in the tower.

30
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.120
The past 20 years of Korean volleyball have been to Kim Yeon-koung

31
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.220
You'll feel like it's condensed.

32
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.820
It's a mega player. The 1st attack, 2nd guard, 2nd open

33
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.320
It's a match between Mega and Kim Hyun-kyung. That's right.

34
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.220
They represent both teams.

35
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.120
1

36
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.320
The 4th round MVP was taken by Mega. Yes

37
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.720
Here's today's selection list. Oh, it's changed a lot. Yes, the home team's articles of association

38
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.520
Kim Chae Na 1, Jeon Dabin 2, Lee Jisoo 3, Lee Sun Woo 4

39
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:45.320
Park Hae-min, number 5 and Lee Hae-dang, number 6. In the case of Jaheungguk Life Insurance, we start with Choi Hyun-ji. Lim Hyerim, Moon Jiyoon, Kim Daeun, Byun Ji-soo, Park Hyo-jin and

40
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.120
Park Soo-hyun is wearing a Libero uniform for the first time. From both teams, Park Soo Hyun and

41
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.220
Lee Hae-dam will make her first professional debut.

42
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.720
I'm Ko Hee-jin, head coach of the home team Jeong Kwan-jang.

43
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.820
These players

44
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.020
I think it's going to be a game where we need to build a foothold for that growth. Yes

45
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.520
Both teams have confirmed that Heungkuk Life is No. 1 in the regular league

46
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.620
In the case of Jung Geun-byung, a large number of players have now been replaced due to injured players. Referee Choi Seong-kwon

47
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:32.620
Next are referee Lee Ju-pil and game committee member Lee Myung-hee.

48
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.220
With Kwon Daejin's pride today

49
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.020
I'm the referee of the game.

50
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.820
Today, the list of people that we've already known

51
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:49.120
It's a bit different from the list of games you've been familiar with

52
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:55.720
It's also fun to see new players. That's right. It's today's game to see the potential of the players

53
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.720
I think that's going to be a point to watch.

54
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.420
If these players impress the coaches in today's game

55
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:09.620
You'll get more opportunities in the rest of the game and more importantly, experience. Yes

56
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.320
It's the last time for both teams to play in the regular season league

57
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.920
It's this game. It could be Kim Yeon-koung's last game in Daejeon.

58
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.420
Well, if Director Jung comes to the championship match, the story will be different, but yes, no one knows that.

59
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.920
It's the last game in the regular league. The first set has begun.

60
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.220
I'm Moon Jihoon from the right. Yes, the god

61
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.520
Good reception and powerful attack from Moon Jihoon came out, and Park Se-hyun

62
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.120
Yes because it's the first time a player is wearing a Libero uniform

63
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.520
There are the most in this stadium today

64
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.020
I was very nervous. Park Soo Hyun has been

65
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.820
I've seen him serve a lot in the middle. That's right.

66
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.520
And in the original industry

67
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.820
They're the main players. Yes

68
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.920
Backtos to the right

69
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.220
Blocked. Scored

70
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.820
Self-sustaining country life

71
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:08.920
At first, the atmosphere looked very good, but Kim Da-won and Byun Ji-soo blocked well. Former player Dabin

72
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.520
In this case, he's been playing since Bukirich's injury, but he's a rookie

73
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.420
He's maintaining his senses in today's game. Yes

74
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:28.780
There was a blocking score by Kim Da-sol. Park Hae-min got it. It's on the left

75
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:40.800
I'm blocked from pushing, Kim Da-eun got Choi Yoon-soo, and I'm Lee Sun-woo. Scoring, the non-mainstream players of both teams

76
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:54.300
Lee Sun-woo and Kim Da-hoon and Moon Ji-hoon are good players because they have been named in the existing national team. Yes

77
00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:03.880
I'm Dabin's serve. I'm looking forward to this season. That's right. It's a little off the south. I'm Dabin

78
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.760
But for the 2nd game in a row

79
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.060
He came out as a starter. Today is the 3rd game in a row. He's very confident

80
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.260
I'm sure I've grown it up a little. Yeah

81
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:25.660
9 points in the previous game, 9 points in the previous game, but I was a player who showed a remarkable attack success rate of 69% in the previous game. Today, the players

82
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:28.660
The result of the game is important

83
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.760
The process is more important. Yes

84
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:36.160
You have to prove it a little bit in a certain way.

85
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.860
Sub-Equity of this index

86
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.460
Park Su Bin already got it. The left side, Si Seok Hoon, Kim Da Eun, that's enough

87
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.260
Back course well gun

88
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.140
It didn't hit the groove. Kim Se-na Back Course, right Lee Sun-woo scores

89
00:10:53.300 --> 00:11:07.020
So, since they're not the players that used to go in, it can be a little confusing in terms of breathing. Yes, then the team that focuses more can gain the upper hand first

90
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:20.880
Now, players with some skills and experience need to lead well at the beginning. Jeonggwanjang Kim Se-ah and Lee Sun-woo have good chemistry so far. That's right. The serve is good. It was a serve. The left side of the tooth is blocked with difficulty.

91
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.580
I couldn't get the down again. a blocked score

92
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:38.060
Is it Lee Hae-dam's blocking score? If you look here, it was Kim Daeun and Lee Hae Dam's blocking points

93
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:53.100
[Voiceover] That's right. Lee Hae-dam is also a member of the volleyball family. That's right. Those who saw it before will know Hong Ji-won. Kim Daeun during the days of Jeong Yi-ho in Honam

94
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.580
Now I'm back in defense. Manager Jung's defense is persistent today. Lee Sung-hoon

95
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:10.800
The straight-scoring player Lee Sun-woo is also an offensive player and a player who can fully play the role of an ace. Yes. From the beginning, Lee Sunwoo scored Jeong Kwanjang's points

96
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:17.380
I'm leading the way. Lee Sun-woo hit it well in a straight line. Player Lee Sunwoo

97
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:31.280
2020

98
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.880
a score of 6 to 3

99
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:46.040
Heungkuk Life Insurance clearly had a good momentum in the beginning, but as Lee Sung-hyun's attack began to explode, Lee Hae-dam's blocking and Park Hae-min's attack are also exploding. Yes

100
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:59.240
And now, Lee Ji-soo's serve continues, and Heungkuk Life Insurance needs to pull it out quickly. That's right. First of all, receiving is important for Heungkuk Life. Jisoo's reception kept shaking

101
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:08.280
Jumpae's serve went out. I was aiming for Kim Daeun, but it's a little off. I think the players need to play more boldly now

102
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:23.280
It's an atmosphere where the coaches of both teams keep encouraging the players rather than pushing them when they make a mistake. Yes, we need to show bold play. Prepare Daeun's serve.

103
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:33.060
Heungkuk Life's rear-end attack, which is a defensive defense by pushing the left seed pine tree. Yes, I couldn't pass it over. It's a mistake.

104
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:47.180
If Kim Daeun's offense players continue to play like this, there will be mistakes that overlap with each other

105
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.240
I've never run before

106
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:55.320
You have to be most careful about this. Lee Seok's serve was aimed at the side bound line

107
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.520
I was aiming for the 5th place

108
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.520
It's a little off. But so far, the coaches of both teams

109
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.820
It's an atmosphere where they understand a lot.

110
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.420
Now, 7 to 5 right now

111
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.820
Both teams are in a hectic situation. I pushed it long and hit it.

112
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.860
Left defense is good. Now, this is a success.

113
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.880
I got Baby Dabi, and left side Park Tae Min

114
00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:35.240
First of all, Jeong Kwan-jang's attack score is much better in the beginning. Yes, Park Hyemin

115
00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:48.460
It was the offensive line of Jeong Kwan-jang, who was holding up well by Lee Sun-woo. First of all, Lee Sun-woo is showing a 75% success rate of three points. Yes, Lee Hae Dam also scored a goal

116
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.140
Park Hye-min is also scoring two points.

117
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:59.820
On the other hand, in the case of Heungkuk Life Insurance, there is no other than Byun Ji-soo's blocking score and Moon Ji-yoon's attacking score.

118
00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.220
Kim Yeon-koung announced her retirement

119
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:10.220
And the game after that was played on Feb. 16 against IBK Industrial Bank of Korea in Hwaseong

120
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:16.620
It's sold out for four consecutive games. That's right. They're showing exclusive tickets until Daejeon today

121
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.120
Including the rest of the children's games and the championship game

122
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.920
It's going to be sold out. Yes

123
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.420
You have to hurry up and make a reservation.

124
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.120
Yes, we have to let him go

125
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.220
You don't want to let me go. Kim Hyunkyung played for four seasons

126
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.920
There were times when foreign players were now in first place

127
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.420
There were times when Kim Yeon-koung took the position

128
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:48.520
It was number one in all indicators of the attack. That's right. Among Korean players, he's No. 1 in attack

129
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.920
No. 1 in scoring and No. 1 in pick-open

130
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:59.120
Kim Yeon-koung, who is in first place in all areas of rear attack. I've received 3 laus emphys this season

131
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.620
It was Kim Yeon-koung. Cha Hyun-ji

132
00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.720
The Olympics are up there.

133
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:11.920
Jeon Dabin from the left. Yes, Jeon Dabin's score. Like today's game, the main player

134
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.520
If you take both players out

135
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.220
You can prove how much depth this team has. Yes

136
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.820
Uh, it's still early in the first set, but Director Jung's depth looks better.

137
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.720
Jeon Da-bin is a complete rookie. That's right.

138
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.220
Park Hae Min's sub, Kim Daeun

139
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.820
Park Soo-hyun's 2nd stage of surprise 2nd stage attack passed it for now.

140
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.120
Push from the center

141
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.520
Moon Jiyoon posted it and Choi Eun Ji again

142
00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.660
This is Jeong Kwan-jang, who is defending. I got 1 point for the left answer.

143
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:57.560
Rather, it was deflected off the net and fell to the side without a defender. Park Se-hyun, of course, continues to practice as a libero

144
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:10.180
I did, but it's my first time playing in a game right now. That's right. I'm very nervous. Since the warm-up, my face has been a bit blurry. That's right. He looked very nervous.

145
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:19.580
This time, it's a 10-to-6 sub mistake. But it's really big to have players step on the court as the main players during the regular season

146
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:33.480
It can be seen as an opportunity, and of course, you will be nervous, but if you play well today, you will have grown a lot without realizing it. Yes, I'm the director. It's currently trailing by 10 to 5. I was nervous about Nishi-gu

147
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:42.080
Park Hae-min's second-tier attack scored a dedicated tie and right Moon Ji-hoon on the back course

148
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.560
So it can't be perfect. The players in the setter position must be very nervous

149
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.860
I'm not as accurate as the main players I used to play

150
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.260
I have no choice but to lose, but the strikers here

151
00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.560
How you handle it is more important. Yes

152
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.760
Daegu is a game of prediction. Right, you have to move in advance

153
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:06.820
It's a game between players who have not played as the main players so far today, when their feet need to be fast.

154
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.020
I think Jeon Dabin is

155
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:22.220
But I think I'm very confident because I played two games first.

156
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.720
Anyway, in this situation

157
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.920
There needs to be someone who is the ace of both teams. So, Jeon Da-bin is playing that role well in the Jeonggwanjang right now. Jeon Da Bin is a rookie

158
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.920
I'm a player, but I started in the first set in the previous game.

159
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:43.320
Arthur's left side missed Choi Eun-ji's ball. Lee Jinsoo

160
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.620
I had a block in the front and Kim Chae Ra was next to me

161
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:53.720
When I block the ball and look back, if I can't see it anywhere, it's behind my head. Yes

162
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.520
Lee Jisoo missed the ball

163
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.120
Heungkuk Life's Choi Eun-ji's first score came out.

164
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.020
And Choi Eun-ji fell into the back. Choi Eun Ji's serve

165
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.320
I'm worried about the issue.

166
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:21.140
I raised it high. Jaheungguk Life Insurance scored twice, Kim Se-ah, a fastball, to the left, and scored like that in the first die, you feel the thrilling taste of your hands.

167
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:34.460
It was the blocking of Moon Ji-hoon and Lim Hye-rim. The ball was already in the blue tone because it was a little stuck. Yes, that's what happened.

168
00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:48.860
The two players were perfect. The left test ticket is covered by the attack this time. Second, Moon Ji Hoon. This time, heresy Park Soo Hyun and Kim Daeun

169
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.780
It's out of the way.

170
00:19:49.920 --> 00:20:04.340
Kim Da-hoon hit a lot of points inside the court right now, so the court space on the right side is a little short. It was this short. That's right. You have to aim for the back more than pushing for a longer time.

171
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:13.020
So when players hit roughly, you have to pay attention to the shorter court. Kim Daeun, yes, I'm going to solve it this time.

172
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:24.740
First of all, I'm looking forward to Kim Da Hoon because he's always a promising player and he's shown great performance in the national team. Yes

173
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:37.120
I had a shoulder injury and suffered a little from the injury, but now it's time to show. Kim Da Won is a very aggressive player. This season, he played 19 games and played 50 sets

174
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:49.220
It's A.C.E. Lee Hye-rim's serve score came out. Director Ko Hee-jin requested the operation time. Here, Lim Hyerim's

175
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.400
It was a short serve. The 3rd serve ace of this season

176
00:20:53.480 --> 00:21:08.440
Even before now, the striker doesn't have a lot of crosses, right? Why are you missing all three or four defenses? No, I'm trying to relax. You have to catch the paint bound one after another. It's hard

177
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:17.640
I told you to understand exactly what I'm saying and get ready to play defense

178
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:30.040
Now, the players have to accurately recognize what the coach is saying during the operation time. Yes, you have to know exactly what you ordered and what the director wants.

179
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:37.500
Lee Hye-rim's serve score came out now, but you have to accept the ball that you can receive enough.

180
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:44.440
All the players who haven't played much today started. But today, we're in Daejeon

181
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.440
The soccer gym is full. That's right. Of course, now

182
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.540
I don't want to let go of Kim Yeon-koung

183
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.560
Fans came to Daejeon Stadium. Yes, I'm supporting the players again.

184
00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:02.140
It was Choi Hyo-seo who was a little nervous at this moment. Backtoss of Korea Life to the right

185
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:15.220
It went out, right? Yes, Moon Ji-hoon continues to deal with bad balls. Yes. Blockout score is also expected

186
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:30.260
In fact, he was a setter player who received a lot of attention, but he had a lot of injuries. Yes. We need to take the opportunity. This season, Park Hae-jin appeared in 15 games and threw up 20 sets.

187
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:36.040
This time, it's out. a mistake on the serve

188
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:48.380
I don't think there's anything so complicated that the coaches of both teams ordered from the players in today. I'm sure you've talked a lot about the basics.

189
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:56.260
Park Soo-hyun strongly received Jeon Da-bin's serve and scored right Moon Ji-hoon's block

190
00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:11.380
Now, Park Hae-min was keeping it exactly right. Yes, since Moon Ji-hoon's score was blocked, coach Amun Nan-ja pressed the ship to announce the operation time.

191
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.300
Yes, in the current situation, manager Abondaji talked to Park Heejin and Moon Jihoon

192
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:58.500
When the ball is not good, don't hit it too hard, but look at the next opportunity with consecutive paint. Yes.

193
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.100
First of all, Park Hae Min

194
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.900
I was keeping the straight line exactly. The score is 14 to 12

195
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.000
It's better by two points. Yes, local number

196
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.800
It was a good toss. On top of that, Byun Ji-soo's preparation was also good.

197
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.600
It was a very quick success.

198
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.600
Park Haejin has a good height

199
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:26.200
The position of holding the ball is high. It has advantages.

200
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.700
Oh, yes. He even scored a blocking point

201
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.800
If you do this, it's a tie. YEJI's heart is 177cm

202
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:47.600
A setter position player is about 778cm tall. That's a good height

203
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.000
He even blocked it. Strong

204
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.400
It was good in the beginning

205
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.600
This Jeonggwanjang's attack is being blocked. I became a defense this time

206
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.600
Park Tae Min Jung pushing from the left

207
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:10.460
Now, Park Hae-min gets back and Kim Se-ah again. This is the second time, Park Hae-min and Kim Dae-eun, who turned the score around 15 to 14

208
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:25.480
Now, Kim Daeun is also putting consecutive paint on the side of the middle blocker, and the fact that he sent a signature to the bench as soon as he let go means that he had some orders from the bench before that.

209
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:38.900
I gave a thumbs up while looking toward the bench. It's iced. They lead by 16 to 142 points. Heungkuk Life is definitely a bit stronger on the serve. Yes

210
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.700
It is the second technical timeout as Korea Life succeeded in turning the tables by two points.

211
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:48.880
When both teams win consecutive games, they show strength in serving and blocking

212
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.280
When the main players played, not these players

213
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.280
Korea Life is No. 1 in blocking and No. 2 in serve

214
00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.580
On the contrary, in the case of Director Jeong, he is second in blocking and first in serve.

215
00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:07.780
These two teams were the last match of the fourth round and the first match of the fifth round.

216
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.880
If you compare the GPU with that time, Director Jeong

217
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.380
It fell a little, and Heungkuk Life went up a little.

218
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.480
Hello, Heungkuk Life's last 3 years

219
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.980
No. 2 in the regular league after Kim Hyun-kyung's return

220
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.080
We've won the 2nd place once

221
00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:30.480
That's right. Heungkuk Life Insurance didn't get to lift the trophy in the championship game

222
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.280
I'm sure you'll have a lot of regrets. Yes

223
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.780
And Director Jung has a dream after 13 seasons

224
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:44.380
Uh, I won first place in the regular league once in the 2011-2012 season. At that time, integration

225
00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.380
I'm the real one who won. It's been a long time since I got a good result

226
00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:53.080
That's right. When Han Yoon-hee was the director

227
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.580
The right taegang has changed.

228
00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:03.380
Park Ji-yoon passed over to the right of Park Jong-soo, who became impatient.

229
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.580
It's really out of my mind.

230
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.980
This time, Moon Ji-hoon and Park Jin-soo did not work together

231
00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:15.080
So, you have to make predictions that the strikers might not be in sync

232
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.080
You have to take care of it well.

233
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:23.480
This can also lead to the opponent's mistakes, and Jeong Kwan-jang's players need to be a little more calm.

234
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.580
Lee Ji-soo passed it, but he was out. Amon terminal reduction

235
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:39.880
I liked it with both arms raised. In today's game, the coach

236
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.180
Rather than ordering customers to win, I'm confident

237
00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.780
I'm going to show you the parts that you haven't shown before

238
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.480
I'm going to ask you to show it boldly the most.

239
00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:54.880
If your players show such a lack of confidence, the coach will be angry. Right.

240
00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:02.480
Actually, for today's game, the players who are playing right now for this selection

241
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.580
You put a lot of effort into it. By all means.

242
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.980
Some players have been waiting for years. Yes, I really want you to show it without regret.

243
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:18.400
It's a mistake. Heungkuk Life Insurance is making a mistake on the serve because Moon Ji-hoon's serve was a bit strong.

244
00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:24.160
And Shin Eun-ji goes in and prepares to serve.

245
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:38.580
He serves very well and is one of the players who is receiving a lot of attention in Jeonggwanjang this season. Yes, Shin Eun-ji, who had 18 serve aces this season, strongly serves this time as well. Lysia is good this time

246
00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:51.680
In the scoring area, Park Hae-jin's good play is coming out in the middle. I moved Byeon Jinsoo to the right and showed him the pipe in the middle

247
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:57.360
It's not that the height is high, but it showed a very low and fast connection. I think so.

248
00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.980
Then, he made it 1 to 1 and scored. a three-point gap

249
00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:12.020
Kim Daeun's serve Jeon Da-bin received it and was blocked. The whistle blew.

250
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.080
It was Park Hae Min's mistake

251
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:31.600
The police chief requests that it's not a touch net. Director Ko Hee-jin requested a video review.

252
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.920
Director Jeong's team has requested a video review of four touches.

253
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:53.720
Director Ko Hee-jin's request for a video review of the mistake of the touch is because the mat is shaking a lot as Lee Hae-dam catches the ball. Yes

254
00:29:53.800 --> 00:30:02.480
I'm done with the reading. As a result of the reading, it was confirmed as Heungkuk Life Retouch. Ah, Heungkuk Life is the opposite. That's right. Yes

255
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:17.520
Therefore, the score was taken again by Director Chung as it became not Director Chung's four-touch mistake but Heungkuk Life's four-touch mistake. That's right. The net was shaking really hard without knowing somewhere.

256
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.240
First of all, director Ko Hee-jin's video review was accurate. Lee Seok's serve

257
00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:38.440
It's A.C.E. This is the serve of Lee Sun-woo, who came in well with a one-point gap. I completely pushed it towards the four corners of the number one seat.

258
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:46.800
Lee Sun's serve again

259
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.300
A little short

260
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.300
Choi Eun Ji's left straight line

261
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.380
He's clever and relaxed. He's aiming for course one

262
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.780
It's Choi Eun Ji who gave it to me. Yes

263
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.180
And Choi Hyunjin is

264
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.980
He's a very experienced player. 14th year

265
00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.980
I have a lot of experience because of this.

266
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.780
Jung Hyunjin's strength is age

267
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.880
And a player who can pull it off

268
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.280
Both wings are available. I transferred to the FA this season.

269
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.880
It was a bit of a mistake.

270
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.380
So at this point, both teams

271
00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.880
New players who didn't play

272
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.080
The players who didn't have the chance to participate

273
00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.180
you'll be looking forward to it. Right

274
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.500
When that happens, I'll go in and... Baby iced

275
00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.460
I will do that.

276
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.920
the basis of Park Hae-min's book

277
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:55.940
Both of them are scoring two serve points each. Park Hae-min's serve ace tied the game again with 19-19. It was a long serve.

278
00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.740
Moon Jihoon, who ran until the end, is not good enough

279
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:13.100
Oh, it's the director.

280
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:32.940
Manager Ahmundaza encouraged the players very strongly. If you miss something you can catch, the director will be angry. The reason why you get angry is because

281
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:46.020
If left alone, the players' concentration decreases, which eventually leads to injuries. It was a rebuke mixed with these concerns. That was Park Hyemin's serve. Backtos, right, Moon Jihoon

282
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:54.660
It was Jeon Daeun on the left. Backtoss right rub-and-glue point.

283
00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:08.460
Park Hae-jin is showing a lot of plays using Moon Ji-hoon today. Moon Ji-hoon is currently scoring the most points in Heungkuk Life. Yes, Moon Jihoon

284
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:23.500
I was the MVP of the 2022 Cup. That's right. It is currently showing a success rate of 8 points and 67%. It was Park Hye-bin's exact issue. Left Jeon Da-bin, but he defended himself. Useful blocking and Choi Eun-ji Coit.

285
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:37.060
Yes, a two-point difference of 21 to 19 players came in as a backup without knowing, but there will also be a battle of pride. Ah, I see. And now

286
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:50.020
Players with experience will also have a sense of responsibility that I should play the ace today. Yes, we didn't get a 2 point difference, right? That wasn't right.

287
00:33:50.100 --> 00:34:00.940
The opportunity was either Heungkuk Life Insurance's three-point difference or Moon Ji-hoon's defense. He passed the 3rd stage, and Heungkuk Life Insurance A is sentenced once again

288
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:15.140
Still, Park Hae-jin is boldly using his fastball. Previously, I had good chemistry with Byun Ji-soo and now with Lim Hye-rim. That was Lim Hye-rim's score.

289
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:27.160
Kim Hye-rim went to IBK as a compensation player for Kim Soo-ji in 2023 and returned as a compensation player for Lee Ju-ah after a year.

290
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:37.280
I like Dabin before he succeeds again. There was Park Soo-hyun's defense. Choi Eun Ji and Park Hyemin's defense. Jeon Dabin

291
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:44.300
Park Soo-hyun's defensive backup is out. at a low play

292
00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:49.480
The benefits were quite good, but Heungkuk Life Insurance requests a video review.

293
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:56.180
A video review by Avon Danza. After the defense, Heungkuk Life showed a very low and fast pipe attack

294
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.480
Please participate in the photo shoot.

295
00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.780
I requested a video review of the blocker touchout. I was ruled out

296
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.680
Director Avon Danza's request for a video review of whether this hit the blocker

297
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.080
If I got it right, I understand

298
00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.760
Right hand. Yes.

299
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:30.700
As a result of the reading, it was confirmed as no touch. Yes, it was recognized by Director Jeong's score. The 22 vs. 202 point difference may be a bit disappointing, but coach Avon Dada is also

300
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:40.940
The play itself was very complimentary. Yes. And Jeong Su-ji came out of the articles of association.

301
00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:50.060
He serves well. We have 3 serve aces this season. Yes. It was Kim Daeun behind Jung Soojin's serve.

302
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.720
There was a lot of speed.

303
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:58.020
I'm making it. If you have a certain level of reception, the ball in front of you

304
00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.920
In particular, Park Hae-jin is using b-quick longer than a. Yes.

305
00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.920
He hit the ball from the right side a little more than Lee Ji-soo's position.

306
00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:10.220
If you use b rather than a, you'll move the other blockers a little bit more

307
00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.920
Yes, there is. Today, Moon Ji Hoon

308
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.920
I've been using it a lot, so I'm going to use the movement of the other middle blocker

309
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:23.120
It's a strategy to take a long time. It's a bummer. Choi Eun Ji

310
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.620
23 units right now

311
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.320
It's 21. It's 21

312
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:34.320
The reason why I get angry is. You can see the mistakes clearly.

313
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.820
It was laver rice up. Park Soohyun is

314
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.420
I got it. Push the silver wine to the right of Baek Goose

315
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:48.380
Now, we're in defense. It's over. Heungkuk Life Insurance Co., Ltd. Moon Ji Hoon, Park Hae Min

316
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.160
Heresy attack Lee Sun-gu dragged his mistake down.

317
00:36:53.240 --> 00:37:05.960
Should the course have been a little higher? First, Lee Sunwoo needs to hit from the top. The ball was short and he's right-handed, so he's going to use the step

318
00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:17.040
It's better to take a step and jump from the left. I see. Set point Heungkuk Life 24 to 21. Seo Chae-hyun is here. Seo Chae-hyun Line

319
00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:29.640
Yes, it's a mistake. It's my second business trip this season, and I think I'll be a little disappointed with this sub mistake. Heungkuk Life has 10 mistakes in the first set. There are too many.

320
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:43.400
I sincerely wish these fellow players in the warm-up zone to win. Jeon Da-bin's serve was a little long at 24:22. Skill on the leg

321
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:56.760
It's Lee Ji-soo's clean score. Now it's blue. Lee Jisoo took care of it well Yes, the gap is narrowed down to 1 point

322
00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:11.040
Lee Ji-soo's direct success 24 to 23 Da-bin serves well. That's right. Jeon Dabin's serve. I picked it up well this time. To the right

323
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:24.720
Lee Sung-woo and Park Ji-hoon on the right side of the undercourse received well to see if Park Ji-hoon could go to a tie. And behind Park Hae Min, Kim Chae Ra, Lee Sung Woo, pushing Da Hoon

324
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.900
Let's see if we can finish the set or not

325
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.960
I'm like this.

326
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:37.700
It was handed over, and Park Hae-min's blocked scoring variable Ji-soo finishes the set.

327
00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.780
First of all, the 12th place match

328
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.080
Like him, he was in the warm-up zone today

329
00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.080
They came in, but they showed a very fierce first set.

330
00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.280
In Heungkuk Life, Moon Ji-hoon scored the most points

331
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:57.080
There were a lot of mistakes, but I think we need to supplement these areas. Oh, but Director Jeong is not easy. Follow this to the end. That's right. 25 to 23

332
00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:03.880
Korea Life won the first set. I'll be back with the second set in a little while. I'm Choi Jihwan.

333
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:44.940
Who wins this taste? Show me the taste of the Shanghai burger. It's a Shanghai burger that's crispier with rice flour, and if it's spicy cream, it's Toowoomba sauce

334
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:55.480
Who wins this taste? McSpacy Shanghai Toowoomba Skechers' comfort is strong. I'm always ready

335
00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:04.720
Sketchers hands-free sleeping bins with the power of comfort because you make me a person who continues to challenge for a long time

336
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:46.800
Dodram 2024-2025 season, sixth round of the women's league in the v-League, Jung Kwan-jang, is with KBS Bagger commentator Han Yoo-mi. Heungkuk Life won 25 to 23 in the first set. First of all, there was a slight difference in the attack success rate.

337
00:40:46.880 --> 00:41:01.640
Heungkuk Life Insurance made 10 mistakes. Nevertheless, Heungkuk Life Insurance brought the first set. If you turned on TV today, why didn't Mega and Kim Yeon-koung wear a coat

338
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:16.100
I'm sure you're wondering if he's in Eo-Cheon. The regular league championship has been confirmed. And for Jeong Kwan-jang, today's game is

339
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:28.680
I'm giving more chances to other players. Now, it's time to prepare for the postseason schedule. Right. And in the case of Jeong Kwan-jang, there's the aftermath of Bukinichi and Park Eun-jin's injuries

340
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:34.960
And we're fighting for the 2nd place. We're fighting against Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction

341
00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:49.940
It is right that director Jeong's position is that there should be no more injured players due to the aftermath of the injuries of Uh Bukrich and Park Eun-jin. And now someone has to go into the positions of Bukirich and Park Eun-jin. Yes, so today

342
00:41:50.020 --> 00:42:02.120
You have to do well in a game like this so that you can continue to get a chance. In a way, it's time to compete internally. The attack success rate in the first set is

343
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:14.340
Life was higher. Director Chung is in a situation where he needs to increase the success rate of the attack. Lee Sun-woo is blocked, and the second Lee Sun-woo drops his necktie by pushing it this time. Park Suhyun and Kim Daeun on the left

344
00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:29.920
I have a flat tooth. Oh, it's touch out. Yes, I got hit and left. First of all, Jeong Kwan-jang's players said they didn't get hit, but now four players have admitted it. Okay. Okay.

345
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:44.940
I got caught on Da Bin's finger. It was Choi Eun Ji's serve. Back course, right, Jeon Dabin. Yes. There will be a lot of middle blockers today. Yes

346
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:58.620
Even now, Lim Hye-rim missed the ball. The answer is blocked here and I turned around, but there's no ball. Even though Kim Daeun told me

347
00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.880
The answer is from the right

348
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.180
Moon Ji-hoon on the right.

349
00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:15.540
Oh, yes. I hit you very well with a sharp angle. Moon Ji-yoon scored 8 points in the first set and showed a 43% attack success rate

350
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:28.740
When Lee Sun-woo and Moon Ji-hoon go to the national team, they are competing for this outpost position. Yes, we need to show who is better today. Lee Hyerim's serve

351
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.640
Oh, there is.

352
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:40.480
Now, I got hit by Choi Hyo-seo and left. It's Kim Hye-rim's second serve score.

353
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:49.240
Since the serve is a little long, the players need to find the drop point better. Yes, Kim Hyerim's serve score

354
00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:57.200
Lee Hyerim. Let's move a little bit and take a course

355
00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:02.760
It's Byun Jin-soo's blocking score. The 2nd set of articles of association

356
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.160
The gap was up to three points.

357
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.260
And Park Hae-min came out of Jeonggwanjang

358
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.660
Park Sun-ok is coming in.

359
00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:19.460
Park Sun-wook is also a second-year player. I graduated from Yailshin Women's Award. In the national team by age

360
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.760
Park Sun-ho, who was consistently active.

361
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.540
I scored five points this season.

362
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:35.960
Lim Hye-jin's serve continues. This time, it was Choi Yo-seok, Toss, and Park Sun-wook.

363
00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:40.200
It's blocked. Undertoss Kim Daeun

364
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:55.280
Oh, you did a good job. At the end of Kim Da-won's score, he also gave the ball a lot of rotation to the outside, so he can break even after being hit by the block. Yes, yes

365
00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:06.180
It was deflected off Lee Ji-soo's hand. I'm coach Ko Hee-jin of Kim Dae-eun's score. Precisely, honey

366
00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:14.940
What if you don't show your moves while playing volleyball? You're practicing every day. Fighting

367
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:25.160
In fact, the main players will train a lot during the season, but these non-main players continue to train together

368
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.440
We do it together as partners. Right, we have a lot of training

369
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:34.040
You have to show a lot of what you did during training at a good opportunity like this.

370
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:37.040
The training is at the same level with the same intensity

371
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.320
What was lacking in digesting the same amount was the actual experience. That's right.

372
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:52.080
It was a short serve. I stocked it up as Park Hae-sim Lee Seok-gong. You're in charge of Choi Yoo Seok's height

373
00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:56.280
Starting with Choi Eun-ji, scoring a fastball once again.

374
00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:03.360
Park Hae-jin is definitely using a lot of non-kicks today. So, what kind of set

375
00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:16.100
There are some places that differ from site to site, but there are some centers that can't raise their kicks well. On the contrary, there are some players who can't get a rain kick, but Park Hae-jin seems to be more comfortable with a rain kick. The beginning of the set

376
00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.360
The gap was five points.

377
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:24.520
Now, the attempted expense went well this time. Lee Sun-jin on the right side of the articles of association

378
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:34.620
First of all, it's a situation where we have to start receiving. Right, if the reception goes well, the setter, too

379
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:48.560
The same goes for this connection. There's a play that fits all the beats very neatly. It was Kim Se-ah and Kim Sun-woo's chemistry. That was Lee Sunwoo's breath. Lee Jisoo's serve

380
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:58.420
Take it to the right. Kim Se-ah, once again, Lee Sun-woo has changed. It's now covered.

381
00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:08.480
It's Park Haejin's back-to-back breathing It's too long. He raised it high

382
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:15.620
It's my first time out. It's inside the coat. Lee Sun-woo's score

383
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:27.000
First of all, Moon Ji-hoon and Lee Sun-woo, who are in charge of both teams' apocryphal positions, need to play the ace role of the team. Yes, so now director Ko Heejin

384
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:40.640
I used my time to call Kim Se-ah and Lee Sun-woo. The issue was a bit shaky.

385
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:53.340
I thought it would be FAN K, but I reached out too early. At this point, you just have to roll it up with your fist, but Kim Chan-ah, who failed to control the length.

386
00:47:53.420 --> 00:48:07.940
In the case of Heungkuk Life Insurance, there are a lot of consecutive paint when you don't like the toss. I think so. I'm blocked from moving today. It's Kim Daeun's blocking score

387
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.200
This is the first technical timeout of 8 to 32 sets.

388
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:25.300
Rather than hitting him hard, Lee Sun-woo needs to avoid blocking and hit him or show other techniques using blocking. Yes

389
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:39.060
Two blockers were perfect right now. Lee Sun-woo is a player who has been looking forward to a lot. That's right. Lee Sun-woo and Moon Ji-hoon are both players who played their father's positions by joining each national team.

390
00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:49.240
These are players with strong attack power, but I've named them Jeong Kwan-jang with broken wings. Bukirich and Park Eun-ji are injured. First of all

391
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:55.020
Kiritz got an ankle injury in the game against GS Caldes, and then he's a kite

392
00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:00.020
The first game of the 6th round was against GS Caltex, and Park Eunjin

393
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:02.020
I got an ankle injury.

394
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.520
We don't know when we'll be back

395
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.520
In the meantime, some of the players who are playing right now

396
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.220
You have to play a good role on behalf of them

397
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:18.760
From director Jeong's point of view, it is more advantageous to confirm the second place.

398
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:32.920
Jeon Da-bin is a player who needs to play a role on behalf of Kirich. The current situation will be a huge opportunity for former player Dabin. Yes, it's Park Seonho's fault.

399
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
In fact, Kwak Sun-ok, who was in the same position last season

400
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
He got a lot of attention and I was looking forward to it

401
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.300
This season, Jeon Da-bin is looking for more of that opportunity. That's right.

402
00:49:49.880 --> 00:50:02.820
This time, it's player Moon Ji-hoon. Heungkuk Life Insurance's aggressive parts are all good, and they blocked hard, but there are a lot of mistakes right now. Yes

403
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:14.080
There is almost twice the difference between the articles of association and the articles of association. Heungkuk Life Insurance has 11 captains.

404
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:24.920
President Jung is recording six mistakes. Originally, there are more team leaders than Chung, but that's right. We're all hitting more. Kim Daun on the left

405
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.900
This is a crime. Yes

406
00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:39.360
The players are not aiming well for zero points in any aggressive part. Yes, my eyes are round.

407
00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:54.220
You need to keep this feeling alive. You have to do it confidently and without burden. Once again, Kim Daeun is blocked this time. Player Ahn Yerim's blocking

408
00:50:54.300 --> 00:51:01.580
It's a dot, but Ahn Ye-rim also has a strength in blocking because she has a good height for a setter position.

409
00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:15.480
Ahn Hye-rim is 5 centimeters taller than Yeom Hye-sun, whose main setter is 1 meter 82 centimeters. That's right. So now we have five blocked points this season and six by today's game. Last one

410
00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:41.520
Coach Abondaji has now ordered Park Hae-jin to move and attack a lot of Byun Ji-soo's play.

411
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:55.520
So, it was to move Byun Ji-soo to the right and prepare Moon Ji-hoon for a pipe attack in the middle. There aren't that many moving attacks from both teams today. That's right.

412
00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:02.520
That was Lee Sunwoo's serve. It's Lee Soo. Lee Sun-woo said, narrowing the gap to two points.

413
00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:07.200
So even if you want to play a mobile attack or something else, first of all, receiving

414
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.900
You have to do it. So it was a matter of receiving. That's right. Lee

415
00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.300
You have to have a certain amount of receiving to play a variety of games.

416
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:20.500
It's the same for Lee Sun-woo and both teams, but he's serving strongly.

417
00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:25.800
Once again, it was Lee Sunwoo's serve. Back course right defense is good. It was the first stage of defense.

418
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.500
Hey, and Park Seonho

419
00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:44.660
I'm back again. Wouldn't Park Se-kyung be in sync this time? Lee YE DAM's mistake came out. What I thought and toss

420
00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:56.540
It can come differently. It can come differently, but you also need to be able to cope with this. Jeon Da-bin's defense was good, but that's right. It was Lee Hae-dam. Ten to seven

421
00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:04.760
Kim Daeun's serve is aimed at Jeon Dabin. There's no other purpose

422
00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:06.040
Heungkuk Life Insurance Co., Ltd

423
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.380
this speed of a hundred

424
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:22.100
Park Hye-jin and Byun Ji-soo, who still showed off their mobile attack play. Heungkuk Life Insurance has Kim Suzy and Peach is good at mobile attacks

425
00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:36.860
You have to keep taking the color. Kim Hyun-kyung is now warming up in the warm-up zone. I think it's the first time I've seen Kim Hyun-kyung relax like this while watching the game.

426
00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:47.920
Kim Hyun-kyung and Kim Soo-jin are together. In the case of last season, I couldn't rest a game because I was in a close race with Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction until the end for the top spot in the regular league. Right.

427
00:53:48.000 --> 00:54:01.120
And that eventually served as another paint in the championship game. That's right. Darby ran too much. It's diagonally

428
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:14.080
Okay, the choice was good. In the current situation, it's right to see the blocking and hit it, but it's a matter of accuracy. I was Dabin's fault. The score is 12 to 84 points

429
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:28.160
I'm a rookie this season. Byeon Ji-soo's serve is good. This is the path painting letters on the right side

430
00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:32.180
Grab it and fall into the middle.

431
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:45.680
Some players habitually pass painting when setters are in an avant-garde. Yes, the opposing team blockers and defenders need to prepare a little bit for this.

432
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:59.140
Did you see the empty space in the middle of Ahn Yerim's pass painting? That's right. Lee Yedam's service. Kim Daeun and Park Haejin are kind of hard

433
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:07.620
I didn't know what to do. Choi Eun Ji. Choi Eun Ji also hasn't had many chances to step on the court in recent years

434
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:22.660
Overall, some sense of the game and these parts are not as good as they were in their heyday. Right. Heungkuk Life Insurance is rapidly showing problems in the second-stage connection. That's right.

435
00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:25.720
Park Hae-jin was an attack that went back.

436
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:36.660
Oh, I'm in a hurry. This could be a connection problem. So Moon Ji Hoon's weakness is

437
00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:51.300
That's what I'm saying. Yes, so there are many mistakes when you step on the rear offensive line in a hurry or when you play near a second-stage connection or net. It's class president Jung, who is catching up by one point.

438
00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:58.800
Lee Hae-dam's serve mistake When continuing this atmosphere, you need to put your serve in a more stable manner.

439
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:13.220
The score is Park Hae-jin's serve by 13 to 112 points.

440
00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:17.300
a point of success

441
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:30.020
This kind of set play can come out. Lee Jin-soo is actually a player who needs to go into Park Eun-jin's position and do it. Right.

442
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:44.900
Now that there are remaining games ahead, this ranking of Jeong Kwan-jang may vary depending on what kind of performance he has. Oh, my. Blocking

443
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.040
I'm Lee Ji-soo, who even has a mole.

444
00:56:48.580 --> 00:57:01.680
Lee Ji-soo was a player who appeared a lot during the 2022 Cup. Yes, this was a little low.

445
00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:06.800
Backers right success

446
00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:20.040
Park Hae-jin also prefers to catch it from above and wrap it quickly. The key to this is how well the strikers are timed. Moon Xion's score

447
00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:25.380
14

448
00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:39.480
I'm going to do an under-toss. Right. Choi Hyo-seok, the left answer. Blocking Korea Life Insurance, the second answer

449
00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:40.840
Moon Jihoon and

450
00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.220
I saw Ahn Yerim

451
00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:49.820
First of all, Kim Da Won is keeping a straight line even with Lee Sunwoo's attack

452
00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:54.820
Moon Jihoon is still on the line when Dabin hits him

453
00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:02.600
The other side blocks it. It's blocking all the straight lines. Yes, there is. Choi Yujin

454
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:12.780
I was able to hit a short serve. The gap is widening again by 16 to 133 points.

455
00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:16.960
The two teams are in a fierce battle

456
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.760
The players need to show a lot today

457
00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.560
That way, we can get more opportunities in the remaining games.

458
00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:31.460
There was a lot of empty space in the process of Jeon Da-bin's movement. Yes

459
00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.960
Choi Eun-ji's serve hit the mark.

460
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:40.460
There was a lot of space for the best player to cover. Right.

461
00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.360
Because Jeon Dabin is in the middle

462
00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:46.760
It moves to the right and then to the left.

463
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.260
That's why there were a lot of empty spaces.

464
00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:56.660
Choi Hyo-seok and Choi Ho-seok also came out as starters today.

465
00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:04.360
Choi Ho-sung is also the younger brother of Choi Jung-min of IBK Industrial Bank.

466
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:19.060
16

467
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:23.140
Oh, LEE SU is shaking again.

468
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:30.240
It's Korea Life Insurance, which can also go by point. Piseok High School became a defense this time

469
00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:40.380
Lee Sun-woo's push blocking score is Lim Hye-rim. In this part, Lee Sun-woo needs to make the rebound play more stable.

470
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:55.180
In fact, hitting hard now requires a lot of young players and rookie players, but then when you have accumulated years, you demand a lot of technical skills. Yes, Lee Sunwoo

471
00:59:55.260 --> 01:00:07.380
It's a mistake. It's Jeong Kwan-jang, who is rapidly losing his aggression. It's Jeonggwanjang, where many mistakes are coming out. Yes

472
01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.000
Director Ko Hee-jin, we ask for operation time once again.

473
01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:19.140
You have to move on in a meaningful way

474
01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:27.260
Bosu, if you hit Das with that, you'll have to do something short for Dabin, and you won't come back. You'll have to sign something

475
01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:39.060
How do you keep getting the same thing? Ji-Soo can just hold the short one in front of it. Yes, it's impossible. Yes, the first one

476
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:54.100
We have a promise to each other on receiving. I'll look at the short one, and you look at the long one. I'll look to the right, and you look to the left. There are promised plays between each other, and this is director Ko Yu-jin who points out these parts. Yes

477
01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:07.540
Director Jeong's reception is a little unstable right now. That's right. As a result, the success rate of attacks is also falling rapidly. Choi Eun Ji's serve was on top of the list again. The

478
01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.220
Lee Sunwoo's straight line

479
01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:22.440
Is this a mistake? Heungkuk Life Insurance is out of the scoring. First, I request a video review. Director Ko Hee-jin asked for a block video review on whether or not to touch out

480
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:31.920
Director Jeong's team requested a video review of the blocker touchout.

481
01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:39.360
It's this scene. During this attack

482
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:46.660
If you got it right, Moon Jiyoon, here

483
01:01:46.740 --> 01:02:01.420
It was Lee Sun-woo's straight line. If you got it right, it's Moon Ji-yoon's ring finger. As a result of reading the right ring finger, it was confirmed as no touch. As you are, the score of Korea Life Insurance

484
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:16.460
Lee Sun-woo needs to score some points as he continues to make consecutive mistakes. Only then can your confidence be revived. Yes, the success rate of the attack was falling sharply. I'm still nervous about receiving.

485
01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:23.060
It became Lee Sun-woo's second-tier offensive defense. Park Suhyun, you block to the left again

486
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:30.320
First of all, the ball was falling down from Park Hye-jin's hand. The striker can't hit this.

487
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:45.280
If you hit it, the blocker is in a more advantageous situation, and if this is Lee Ji-soo's block right now, it is Heungkuk Life that needs to be more thoroughly covered. Right. 19 to 14 Park Suhyun

488
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:58.520
Kim Se-ah scored Lee Sun-woo from the right side of Kim Se-ah as Park Soo-yeon pushed from the right side of the single backing

489
01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:05.000
Now, after about three mistakes, Lee Sun-woo scored.

490
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:20.040
I'm definitely Yoo Sun-woo, who is more natural on the right side than on the left. That's right. It was a master attack. Jeon Dabin, rear position 19 to 15

491
01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.940
Park Suhyun's speed

492
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:32.020
I'm giving a lot today. Especially, when Moon Jihoon is preparing for a whitewash on the right side, he's going to use this bequick a lot

493
01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.320
Park Haejin is a player who uses it a lot.

494
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.620
Lee Jinsoo, if Park Haejin keeps using non-kicks today, then

495
01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:43.920
You have to block one more step from the right side. That was Lee Hye-rim's score.

496
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:49.720
I'm using Big Pick more than A-Pick today. Lee Hyerim is the back

497
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.080
Choi Yong-seok's speed is good.

498
01:03:53.860 --> 01:04:03.580
If it's a relief like this, it's better to use the set play. That's right. And in this case, Lee Ji-soo also flew from the right and hit the A flag.

499
01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:14.980
He moved a little more to the left and hit me than the position where the player Byeon Ji-soo was standing. Completely avoided opponent's blocking. 20 to 164 points

500
01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:25.500
It's Shin Eun Ji. Shin Eun-ji's serve was sharp. Direct key success.

501
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:28.580
When I'm a player with good serve

502
01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:33.280
Blockers in the avant-garde need to be thoroughly prepared for directions. Yes

503
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.680
Lee Hae Dam and Lee Sun

504
01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:40.680
I said I'd take care of it, so we bumped into each other

505
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:44.680
This also requires a call sign.

506
01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.180
Kim Dawon got it. Course 1, right side, Kim Eun Ji Hoon

507
01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:53.460
Once again, Lee Sangwoo on the right

508
01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.780
I'm running, but it's hard to run. It's hard. Yes, you have to be careful of your injuries.

509
01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:11.920
Lee Sun-woo scored. Lee Sun-woo's success rate needs to go up a little more. Lee Sunwoo is

510
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:25.500
It shows a success rate of about 33 percentage points. Director Avon Danja requested a blackout time.

511
01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:56.080
It's a 2-point gap

512
01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:03.220
I asked for an operation time. He's pointing out the solution to some strikers one by one.

513
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:16.160
In this case, Rivero is outside the court now. Jung Kwan-jang's shoes are in. Yes, then when it's hard to hit, I was saying to push there now. That was Shin Eun Ji's sub. The risk was good.

514
01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:22.900
I pushed it long to the right, but it became a defense. It's Lee Sunwoo's spirit.

515
01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:32.160
Hit the antenna. So you have to reduce these mistakes. Lee Sunwoo and Moon Jihoon are similar to each other

516
01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:38.680
It's great to have strong attack power, but you need another technique

517
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:41.760
We need to reduce those mistakes that come out in a hurry.

518
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.760
Now, Lee Chae-hoon is in.

519
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.160
Lee Chaemin is the first player of this season

520
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:56.160
This is my first business trip. Yes, this player is Seo Chae-hyun and this player is Lee Chae-min. He's a rookie and he went to a high school for men

521
01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:03.460
I graduated. I'm an outside heater position player, but it overlapped right now. Your line is Park Sunwoo

522
01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:06.160
PARK SI HYUN, you go to the left

523
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:09.800
Kim Daeun's blocking score. Yes

524
01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:21.240
Now, Lee Sun-woo's blocking score came out. First of all, I made the crisis a score. Yes, Kim Daeun is blocked. Lee Sunwoo's blocking

525
01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:30.360
Lee Chae-min of Heungkuk Life Insurance was a 9-year-old data player in high school. Yes

526
01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:37.880
I need to give Lee Sunwoo's serve to the right

527
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:52.560
He's giving it to Daeun. In fact, sectors also need to give a lot of credit to new players. And in case of Seo Chaehyun, he's a teammate of Lee Chaemin

528
01:07:52.640 --> 01:08:03.020
You came in. So you have to do well together to get a chance. It sounds good. Undertoss Park Sun-wook by 3 points after 20 points.

529
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:09.380
Yes, Touch Beast posted it. Touch Four Mistakes This is a four-touch mistake by player Lee Hae-soo.

530
01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:13.200
I can see you're too nervous.

531
01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:28.280
Is it because the center of this touch is a little shaky in Daegu? Oh, because I'm trying to put it in deep like this, there are times when my hand touches the net. Your condition right now

532
01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:34.100
It comes out. I pointed it out, but it's bound to come out

533
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:42.220
A positive fault has occurred. Rather, the serve in the articles of association

534
01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:56.020
It's wrong. Oh, it could be like this if you say it in the sub-rotation of the sub-sunde. Yes, player Lee Hae-dang

535
01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:00.280
If you're in a wrong position

536
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.380
There are cases like this, too

537
01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:10.900
I think Lee Hae-dam's position is wrong. It's a bagger tek crime.

538
01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:19.940
He's out. He's a police chief who keeps making mistakes. Chef's point. Korea Life Insurance

539
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:33.260
Now that the players keep changing, I think we should focus on it. the sub of the variable index

540
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:37.600
Choi Hyoseo got it well and the answer from the left was

541
01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:49.020
I'm Dabin, who used the elasticity of receiving and coming in. Jeon Da-bin was empty. The power of this attack

542
01:09:49.100 --> 01:10:03.840
That's pretty good. The form is very neat, too. Yes, I'm a rookie. Choi Eun-ji's block to see if she can finish this season with Dabin's set points

543
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:17.120
Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders, out 25 to 21 to win the second set. First of all, in the second set, there were a lot of mistakes by Jeong Kwan-jang. Can't find a solution in some aggressive areas. Yes

544
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:28.320
Oh, he followed well until the middle, but he gave up this set as the attack success rate fell sharply. Heungkuk Life is leading with a set score of 2-0. It's Daejeon.

545
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.000
Skechers

546
01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.040
Relaxation is powerful. I'm always ready

547
01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:44.320
Sketchers hands-free sleeping bins with the power of comfort because you make me a person who continues to challenge for a long time

548
01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.140
Change the next schedule to 12 o'clock tomorrow and text Jin.

549
01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:24.680
Who wins this taste? Show me the Shanghai burger taste. It's a Shanghai burger that's crisper with rice flour and spicy cream, even Toowoomba sauce

550
01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.180
Who wins this taste? Max Paci Shanghai Toowoomba

551
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:43.440
Heavy morning uncomfortable day constipation tonight with Makey's herbal ingredients gently with Western medicine ingredients quickly pleasant refreshing exhilarating constipation

552
01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.540
Meikin

553
01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:59.280
From the jaw that couldn't climb to the place where Roborak couldn't conquer, the transformation goes beyond robot vacuums with a new cleaning area. Roborak

554
01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:03.860
The real thing doesn't hide behind the picture.

555
01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:12.100
The real furniture that you can tell by touching it. Real furniture by people who know something

556
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.700
Hypers

557
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:28.960
You have a lot of worries when choosing Omega 3, right? Why is plant-based Omega 3 the trend? Plant-based omega-3s are free from marine pollution and heavy metals. What about the absorption rate? Koryo Onda has high bioavailability as well as body absorption.

558
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:41.900
Since it's Goryeo Ondan, you can trust the ingredients Sure. Good raw materials are filled with the highest elevation omega 3 of basic dsm4. So, the most popular answer is plant-based

559
01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:56.940
I've decided what to eat in Korea Ondan Vegetable Altage Omega 3. We worked together. It's American premium pizza Papa John's. I ate a whole bowl of authentic food.

560
01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:03.700
Dad, let's eat jeon together. Who wins this taste? Show me the Shanghai burger taste.

561
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.540
It's a Shanghai burger that's crispier with rice flour and spicy cream noodle Toowoomba sauce

562
01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.160
Who wins this taste? Max Paci Shanghai Toowoomba

563
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:29.340
Sketchers comfort is powerful. Sketchers hands-free sleeping bins with the power of comfort because they make me who is always ready and continues to challenge myself for a long time

564
01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:02.560
Dodram 2024 2025 Season V-League Women's 6th Round Jeonggwan Jangdae Heungkuk Life Insurance

565
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.340
The three-set match will begin now. We are with Han Yu-mi, a commentator.

566
01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:10.440
1

567
01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:16.240
Players who have not played as main players are playing as main players. When it was a non-mainstream event for everyone

568
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.040
You know, that's right. To be honest, I wasn't the main player from the beginning

569
01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.040
Right, but I think

570
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.140
It could be an opportunity for someone who's ready

571
01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.340
If you're not ready, this is a crisis

572
01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.840
It's possible. But it might be a bit embarrassing

573
01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:37.340
Let's see who had the chance and how well they trained

574
01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.640
I think it's a place where I can show you.

575
01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:48.140
Since the announcement of Kim Yeon-kyung's retirement, Chungmu Gymnasium has been selling out

576
01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:56.940
It's the same today. That's right. Heungkuk Life has sold out in all the games, but standing in front of so many people

577
01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.140
The players need to show good performance

578
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.640
Of course, a lot of fans

579
01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:09.040
You came to cheer for Kim Yeon-kyung or Jeong Kwan-jang's main players

580
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.540
We're going to find another new star

581
01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:15.000
It's a place where you can do it. By all means.

582
01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.640
I have to make these fans my fans.

583
01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:33.000
Now, the third set match will begin. We are preparing with Kim Chae-na's serve. I saw Kim Hyun-kyung. The third set started with Kim Chae-na's serve. In the last set

584
01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.780
the home team's articles of association. As soon as we started

585
01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.380
YOON JI WON scored in a straight line

586
01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.980
First of all, Park Hae Jin is better than the first set

587
01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.080
My toastie got a lot better. Height

588
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.480
Saturn, which catches and shoots quickly, has improved accuracy.

589
01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.780
The RBI was properly caught this time. That's right. Kim Jihoon

590
01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.580
Moon Jihoon is currently 13th

591
01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:56.080
He's scoring. Yes

592
01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.780
Open to the left

593
01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.380
Yes, I fail to defend.

594
01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:15.180
Moon Ji-yoon and Lee Sun-woo of both teams are in the same position and scoring the most points in the team, and Lee Sun-woo is in the second set

595
01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:21.280
He scored seven points but was negative in terms of attack efficiency. Right.

596
01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:27.980
Rather than scoring, there were a few more mistakes now. It's a story that he was blocked by the other blocker

597
01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:32.680
This time, I pressed it with 20 cleanly, but it doesn't stretch much more.

598
01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:44.320
First of all, I think it's the same for both players. You have to handle the bad ball well. Yes, Moon Jihoon is 20

599
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:57.980
At the time of MVP in the 22nd Cup, he was now a member of GS, but the attack success rate exceeded 70% in the final. That's right. Jeon Dabin's serve came in well again this time. On the right, Eun Ji Hoon.

600
01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:11.620
Yes, if this works well with Park Hae-jin, Moon Ji-hoon is also having a very good attack. I gave him a thumbs up now. Who did you thumbs up to? Park Hae Jin or Moon Ji Hoon

601
01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:26.120
I think it's both. Moon Ji-yoon's serve Choi Hyo-seok was difficult to toss as he moved, and it was Park Hae-min who is making it a goal.

602
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:33.600
Park Hae-min also returned to the fourth round due to an injury this season. Right, he has basic skills

603
01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:48.040
I'm Jeong Kwan-jang, who has a lot of expectations in the outsider data position. Director Jung is leading by a score of three to two

604
01:17:48.120 --> 01:18:01.980
Mitch is anxious. Yoon Ji-hoon and Park Soo-hyun were blocked by Lee Sun-woo's block on the right side of the back course from Dabin before the long process and scored 7 points with the left open post.

605
01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.460
Wasn't it too visible this time?

606
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:09.660
That's right. It was Kim Cheolhwan who had no choice

607
01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:13.560
Here, Park Hae-min is also carrying a little bit of the ball.

608
01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.160
Park Hae-jin pressed it with a blue king.

609
01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:27.460
Park Hae-jin's blocking score. Kim Dae-eun's persecution of serve

610
01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:31.640
That was my goal. Lee Sungwoo on the right

611
01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:46.820
Lee Sung-hyun also caught an RBI and played well in that course because the 5th course was completely empty. Yes. Park Soo-hyun was also joining the defense in the forward, so seat number 5 was empty.

612
01:18:46.900 --> 01:19:00.640
4

613
01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:12.840
He handed it over carefully and even before the straight line Park Hae-min's 5-32 point difference. When Park Hae-min hits the ball right now, Park Hae-jin leaves the straight line a little empty. Yes.

614
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:26.700
So here, Park Hae-min is aiming for that space. The space between Park Hae-jin and the antenna was just empty, so I put it in that spot. Lee Sunwoo's serve continues. Park Suhyun

615
01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:30.540
It's a backdose right-hand moving attack fault. All right.

616
01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:32.820
I'm trying to claim touch out

617
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:44.780
The referee's decision that he was hit by the blocker's hand was correct. It was the score of Jaheungguk Life. It was a moving attack score by a blocker touchout score variable.

618
01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:59.320
Keeping up with one point, the 5-4 mega is now watching the game in the warm-up zone. The main players of both teams are missing today. a local sub

619
01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:09.500
I had a hard time coming out. That's why the connection is so urgent. both sides. Yes, of course

620
01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:13.180
There's a difference between training and the actual game

621
01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:22.080
But to some extent, players have to control their distance and things like this. That's right. Yes

622
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.380
Actually, the best training is

623
01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:27.120
There is also talk of losing points, that's right.

624
01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.900
That's how much we're going to talk about our sense of reality

625
01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:46.100
It's a little lacking. There are balls that you shouldn't hit hard on the right side, because you hit too much on the right side. Yes Yes Yes Yes You don't have to overdo it.

626
01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:50.540
So-called soothing. Yes, yes

627
01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.500
It was Eun Ji Hoon's fault, 6 to 5 by 1 point.

628
01:20:54.920 --> 01:21:06.720
Park Hae-min's serve was successful. I think he used an aik, not a kick this time.

629
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:19.640
Yes, that's right. Yes, I'm using a variety of fastball plays today. It was Park Hae-jin and Lee Hye-rim's ace chemistry. a six-to-six tie

630
01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.400
It's the beginning of the third set.

631
01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:34.360
Kim Se-ah's high open Kim Da-won touched her hand and yes, it's hard. Yes, you don't have to overdo it.

632
01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:46.240
First of all, the bench quickly avoided it, but as the two players came, Park Se-hyun looked at Choi Eun-ji once. Then, I was late. Right.

633
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:53.400
7

634
01:21:53.540 --> 01:22:08.500
It was Lee Yedam who was disappointed. So, Jeong Kwan-jang had nine mistakes in the second set. It's the articles of association that need to be reduced. Yes, the errors of the articles of association have increased compared to the first set. In the second set

635
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:18.180
Choi Eun-ji's sub. Missy-gu was good this time. It's a straight line, but it's a mistake. It went outside.

636
01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:25.520
It's a little delayed. I thought the reception was correct this time, but I'm asking for a video review.

637
01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:35.700
Director Jeong's team has requested a video review of the in-out.

638
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.280
Video Read Request In-Out

639
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.640
Let's.

640
01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.120
Yes, yes

641
01:22:47.640 --> 01:23:00.980
When you're most pressed, you can see the inside of the boundary line, so the left side, so yes, it's like this. Yes, it's "in" if you say so. That's right

642
01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:02.820
If you can't see it, it's 1.

643
01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:12.140
Yes, if this happens, Jeong Kwan-young's score is recognized. It's a local rule of 8 to 7 kobo, so the v-League in Korea. That's right.

644
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:23.120
When the maximum pressure is applied, the boundary line further inside must not be seen to be recognized as In. In a video review

645
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:36.340
The score is 8 to 71 points, and there is a tight race. Lee Sun-ho scored 13 points today, Moon Ji-hoon of Korean Life scored 14 points before Da-bin and Byun Ji-soo scored 7 points, respectively, Park Hae-min and Lee Hye-rin scored 6 points and 7 points, respectively

646
01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:38.820
It's a tight scoring structure.

647
01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:41.620
First of all, the players

648
01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.720
The position where you score

649
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:50.620
I think it's a little different. Yes, in the case of Director Jung, after Lee Sun-woo, both Jeon Da-bin and Park Hae-min's wings

650
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:54.720
This is how the triangle formation is formed. In the case of Heungkuk Life

651
01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.120
After Moon Jihoon, there are Byeon Jisoo and Lim Hyerim

652
01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:02.320
Byun Ji-soo and Lee Hye-rim are middle blockers. Yes

653
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:10.020
That's how fast Heungkuk Life is using today. He's receiving better than Jeong

654
01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:14.520
There is. That's right. And there's also the style of the setter

655
01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:19.120
In the case of Park Hae-jin, it is good to use a middle blocker today. Yes

656
01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:24.120
It's Park Haejin. Park Hae Jin scored 2 points today

657
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.660
I'm recording it as blocking.

658
01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.180
This time, the right side of the backfinger

659
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.520
This was Moon Jiyoon. Lee Sang-ho scored the goal.

660
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:48.140
Lee Hye-rim and Lee Hye-rim followed and put them on well, and if you look at Heungkuk Life's blockers now, there's not much space between them. Yes, middle blockers too

661
01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:59.040
He is blocking closely, and now it is recorded as Kim Daeun's blocking score. It wasn't his name, it was Kim Daeun. The score is 8 to 8

662
01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:13.320
I pushed Kim Hye-rim's serve. Heungkuk Life Insurance, which went in after hitting the net and is defending right Jeon Da-bin, was pushed out of the right open attack. It's out.

663
01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:26.300
Eun Ji-won's right-handed person has to step very well when he hits the ball from the right. Yeah. There's a ball that I can hit diagonally and a ball that I can't hit, and depending on that, the last step

664
01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:40.560
The direction controls it. You have to step well. The score is 9 to 81 points ahead, Jeong Kwan-ja, non-conspirator Byeon Jin-soo. Yes

665
01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:53.260
I'm intentionally using a lot of middle blockers today. This time, Choi Eun-ji's reception was very accurate. It was a non-kick even now. Yes, I'll make up my mind

666
01:25:53.340 --> 01:26:08.340
Big Kick Success Using Jeon Ji-soo 9 to 9 Moon Ji-yoon's serve went in well. It was 20% shaken a lot. Director Chung's opportunity is Heungkuk Life once again. Park Soo Hyun and Park Hae Jin

667
01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:22.680
Pushing Dahun to the left. Yes, even now, Kim Chae-hwan was preparing for consecutive hits, but Kim Da-hoon poked it toward No. 8 for a little longer and scored.

668
01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:25.220
Kim Da-hoon had a very good vision.

669
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.800
10

670
01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:39.700
Kim Da-eun scored 8 points and 9 points today. Lee Sun-woo on the right is ready, right? We're running, and we're running, but we're going to eight seats.

671
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:49.520
Choi Hyun-ji touched it. In Jeonggwanjang right now, more scorers need to come out after Lee Sun-woo.

672
01:26:49.600 --> 01:27:02.520
Yes, Lee Sun-woo's attack success rate is close to 35%. That's right. We need to pull it up a little bit more.

673
01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:15.080
The right-hand movement attack is back. Heungkuk Life Insurance Park Haejin Kim Da Hoon, your convex shot

674
01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:21.260
Yes, like this, you have to use your wrist to aim for a blocking touch-out.

675
01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:25.660
In fact, the strikers used their wrists at the end

676
01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:28.260
You know, you're setting the direction. Yeah

677
01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.260
So when we say that we use our wrists well

678
01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:38.960
It's applied to this area a lot now. Right. It's very much like this. Kim Daeun's serve mistake

679
01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.260
11

680
01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:43.980
in a tight way

681
01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:58.880
Both teams' scores are changing as if they are walking on thin ice. These players haven't played all the full sets like this before. That's right. Lee Sunwoo's serve from the beginning

682
01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.040
Park Suhyun is shaking. And

683
01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:08.460
It's long. Choi Hyoseok, Kim Chae Na, or Park Hae Min on the left

684
01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:22.220
There are three blocks, but they fell through the blockers. Yes, this is a 3:1 lead.

685
01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:35.700
He gave me a good RBI. That was Park Hae-min's score. Director Subunza requests operation time.

686
01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:07.780
Oh, it was the egg director's operation time. They're asking how Lee Sunwoo's serve style is. Yes

687
01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:21.860
Now it's Park Hae-min's attack process, and the RBI was alive. Coach Abondaji caught the sub-rhythm of Lee Sun and Lee Sun-woo through the operation time, but this time it became an issue and a mobile attack

688
01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:27.360
Kim Se-ra, Si Seok-kwon, Park Hae-min's back

689
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:42.480
The RBI is a bit alive right now. Yes, rather than hitting any deep diagonal or sharp straight line, I'm catching the RBI and hitting it long toward the end line. Yes, it was an attack using RBI. Park Hae Min

690
01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:57.220
The score is 13 to 11 Lee Sun-woo's serve. This time, we're going to defend ourselves in the dining kill. Choi Eun-ji scored consecutive hits

691
01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:09.460
Heungkuk Life Insurance, who defended well first, and Choi Eun-ji also showed a technique of returning to the first course because the ball was a little short now. Yes

692
01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:24.660
It was Cha Eun-ji's back-to-back score for the No. 1 spot. Choi Eun-ji's defense, pushing Park Hae-min by a point again

693
01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:38.860
And Choi Eun-ji's four teams, and now Kim Chan-hwan is trying to pass it over, and he made a mistake. Yes

694
01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:52.800
You have to hand it over to the other court. Yes, yes, yes. We handed it over to our court. Again, 13 to 13 serve

695
01:30:53.060 --> 01:31:03.120
Park Hae-min 8,000 Still, Park Hae-min's attack is reviving in the third set.

696
01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:17.680
This is Jeong Kwan-jang, who Park Hae-min showed a very noticeable performance in the middle of the third set. Jeong Kwan-jang

697
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:26.560
Way to go! Back to the right, Moon Ji Hoon, left, Jeon Dabin

698
01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:39.240
This didn't lob at the kyohoe. Jeon Da-bin's Score In Jeonggwanjang, the left wing is recovering little by little. Park Hye-min also survived, and Jeon Da-bin's offensive score came out now.

699
01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:53.620
Lee Hyerim hit his hand and splashed to the side. Park Hae Min's serve by 15 to 132 points. Choi Eun Ji

700
01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:57.240
Direct Kick. This time, it was Izas Peking.

701
01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:08.980
Leader Pass Painting Success Seo Chae-hyun is also playing in the second game this season. Today, we're receiving opportunities for every set

702
01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:17.720
Seo Chae-hyun is also the younger sister of Pepper Savings Bank. Yes

703
01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:28.900
He came in. He's the ace of serve. Seo Changhoon moved to GS Yes, that's right It's in the cell

704
01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:43.540
Now, 15 to 15 again, the equalizer Seo Chae-hyun came in perfectly from there. The first serve score came out. The reception is shaky. I'm Da Bin, Park Soo Hyun. Yes.

705
01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:45.460
Park Suhyun threw his body away

706
01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:52.180
It didn't fit. So, right now, Lee Hyerim is on the blue king side of Jeonhee's side

707
01:32:52.260 --> 01:33:04.100
That's what I was saying. And my defense was getting broader. Yes. Park Hae-min and Jeon Da-bin are recovering little by little in Jeonggwanjang.

708
01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:19.020
16

709
01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:25.440
It's the latest v-League women's game in which the procession continues.

710
01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:28.520
The variables are outside the court

711
01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.620
I'm rooting for you, but yes

712
01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:36.620
Those players now have an instinctive desire to play on the court like this. By all means.

713
01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:39.820
Heungkuk Life is currently blocking

714
01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:42.620
Ten, six for Jeong

715
01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:52.020
Heungkuk Life is overwhelming when it comes to submission. That's right. Heungkuk Life Insurance scored eight stonemasons. If you look at the numbers that came out right now

716
01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:55.720
In other words, Korean life's receiving is good. That's right.

717
01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:10.180
Yes, it was a bold attack by Da Bin. Jeon Da-bin has a 9 point success rate of 69% against GS on Feb. 22

718
01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:22.580
Then, on February 26, just before the game, he scored nine points in the game against Gs, but the probability of aggression decreased a little then. That's right. It's 33%. Choi Eun Ji

719
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:37.100
Before hitting consecutively on the left, Da-bin Park Soo-hyun and Choi Eun-ji, glass blocking Lee Sun-woo came in straight from behind. Point. Four, two points apart

720
01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:50.520
As Jeong Kwan-jang's attacks began to revive little by little, this Daejeon gym became a little noisy. That's right. That was Lee Sun-woo's score.

721
01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:59.940
The score was 17 to 152 points. Moon Jihoon on the right

722
01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:14.180
Blocka Tachie Out Seo Chae-hyun hasn't received many opportunities, but yes, looking at it now, toast is okay. Before this match, Seo Chae-hyun appeared in just one game and one set for a while. That's what I'm saying

723
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:27.740
It's just that I didn't get many opportunities, but it's a possibility. Yes, I'm Heungkuk Life's Sepper. Seo Chae-hyun, Choi Woo-seok, Lee Su-soo, was shaken. Search out Jeong

724
01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:33.320
Jeon Da-bin is also continuing to aim for a straight course.

725
01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:45.820
Yes, it hits Moon Ji-hoon's right hand and goes in, but he pierced it well even though he already hit it next to the antenna. It was a scene that showed the aggressive talent of Jeon Da-bin. That's right.

726
01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.440
Now, Moon Ji Hoon

727
01:35:47.540 --> 01:36:02.160
First, he passed it over and Lee Sun-woo was defended from the left side of the articles of association. And behind Kim Daeun, Lee Sunwoo is defending

728
01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:17.200
Seungmin's right blocking score is Lee Sungwoo. Now, Lee Sun-woo is well aware of the habits of Lee Moon Ji-hoon. Yes, in a one-on-one situation, I swept it inward momentarily.

729
01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:29.960
Yes, Lee Sun-woo's blocking score continued to be two points apart by one point, and now it is three points apart, so coach Aminganja asks for an operation time.

730
01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:54.980
Director Avonanza

731
01:36:55.060 --> 01:37:01.520
He pointed it out slowly and specifically. You can't hurry now.

732
01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:14.700
You need to increase your concentration a little more. Kim Chae-ra's serve

733
01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:17.700
I'm stuck in the first air. a four-point gap

734
01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:21.300
Now, Jisoo's blocking score. Yes

735
01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:36.340
So, because Seo Chae-hyun showed so much in advance that he would raise the kick, Lee Jin-soo participated in blocking at the exact timing. This is what was read. I came in properly because it's going to be damaged. The score was up to four points. Again

736
01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:45.740
Choi Ji-in came in. On the right, Choi Yooseok. Undertoss

737
01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:59.400
Blocking Score Kim Daeun's blocking score. Jeon Daeun left it to Kim Daeun. These days, there are so many players with similar names. There are 2 Lee Jooha and Kim Daeun

738
01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:10.440
In the case of today, Park Hye-min and Park Hye-jin have a similar name. I think so. I got more confused because you said that.

739
01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:21.700
I didn't know, but I'm Jeon Daeun. I'm a Dabin player. I'm a Dabin player. Yes, and Heungkuk Life has Kim Dasol.

740
01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:25.120
20 to 17

741
01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:39.520
It was connected from the center of the right-handed seat behind Kim Ta-sun's serve. You have to move on. I've moved on. I'm Dabin, Kim Chae Na, left, Lee Sunwoo, straight

742
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.740
The limit is

743
01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:56.260
It's Jeong Kwan-jung's score. Yes, Lee Chae-min said he didn't get hit. Director Abu Nanja asked for a video review of the operation time. Yes

744
01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:03.680
Video Read Request A video read for four touches was requested on any day.

745
01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:09.380
Video read request to Touchnet.

746
01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.060
Then, let's talk about three players who made a mistake in the touch rap

747
01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:29.720
Yes, since the touch mistake came out, the referee raised his hand to Director Jeong with your touch mistake and didn't do it. Now we've asked for a video review that we didn't.

748
01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:43.280
Korea Life Insurance Co., Ltd

749
01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:57.440
It was a readout request about whether the player made a touch lap bust or not. Yes

750
01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:12.480
The screen is frozen for a moment. Jisoo Byun said no more

751
01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:29.400
On the way down, four Byeon Jisoo and Lee Chaemin read the results

752
01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:43.120
Yes, it was confirmed by touch. It's confirmed that it's a touch versus a mistake. Yes, the original judgment was valid. I think it's Byun Ji-soo's elbow. YEON JI SU and LEE CHAERYEONG

753
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:50.080
I touched the net a little on the way down, and I think I'm talking about that part.

754
01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:54.180
Now, it's a 4-point difference. 21 to 17

755
01:40:54.380 --> 01:41:07.540
The error of the variable index touch was confirmed as a result of the video review. Daeun's serve before the 4 points difference of 21 to 17

756
01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:17.760
I'm Dabin. I'm Dabin. Did Lee Sung Hoon go out? It's a sword room.

757
01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:25.820
It's a judgment that it's out of the way. If so, the articles of association request a video review.

758
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:35.200
I'll wait a moment for the results. The normal team of director Ko Hee-jin's operation time requested a video review of the blocker touchout.

759
01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:41.240
Video read request for block out.

760
01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:49.260
If you got it right, Byeon Jisoo's third finger

761
01:41:50.280 --> 01:42:02.620
It was determined that he was hit by a point local in the articles of association. Now, Lee Sunwoo is scoring 17 points now. Yes

762
01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:13.520
It has 17 points and a 35% success rate. 22 to 175 points

763
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:26.020
I played a strong serve

764
01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.660
Here's the second one. Lee Sun-woo's defense is good. That was Park So-hyun's defense. Kim Daeun

765
01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:43.900
Oh, it falls while holding this. I'm trying to make a strong hole. Yes, Kim Daeun penetrates this. That was Park Ji-hyun's defense.

766
01:42:43.980 --> 01:42:58.940
It was Kim Daeun's ball per hour 22 dash 8 example and it was Park Hae-min.

767
01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:04.780
With Yoon Jihoon's quick serve

768
01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:16.060
I'm in defense. Once again, Kim Da-woon put Choi Woo-sung well this time, blocked, and somehow became a caba. getting up

769
01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:22.020
Baek Gu-su's right side came down to the ventricle. The RBI is

770
01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:25.900
Eun Ji-won's attempt at a back attack failed

771
01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:32.060
But when Park Hae-jin comes in, he's giving a lot of balls to Moon Ji-hoon. Yes

772
01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:39.060
Moon Ji-hoon did a very good job until the second set. Of course, the success rate is falling little by little.

773
01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:41.260
It was a right rear attack error.

774
01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:44.360
Moon Jihoon 23 to 185 points

775
01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:49.120
That was Jeong Suji's serve.

776
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:50.560
right

777
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.480
I did it once, and yes, I swept it.

778
01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:10.480
24

779
01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:15.960
The players' concentration went up more in the third set. Yes

780
01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:20.440
Jung Suji's serve briefly

781
01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.400
Ace

782
01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:24.760
25

783
01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:38.820
Jeong Kwan-jang's counterattack in the third set succeeded, making a sand score of 2 to 1. In the third set of English Life, some success rate of the attack was a little low, and on the contrary, the attack by the chief of the articles of association was revived

784
01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:52.080
My concentration has gone up. It was Director Jeong who succeeded in counterattack with a score of 2 to 1. We are with commentator Han Yu-mi at Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon. It's Daejeon.

785
01:44:53.380 --> 01:45:07.260
Heavy morning uncomfortable day constipation tonight with Makin herbal ingredients soft with Western medicine ingredients quick pleasant refreshing exhilarating constipation

786
01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:14.200
Making Sketchers comfort is powerful. I'm always ready

787
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:23.420
Sketchers hands-free sleeping bins with the power of comfort because you make me a person who continues to challenge for a long time

788
01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:48.920
That

789
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:25.980
Dodram 2024 2025 Season V-League Women's 6th Round Jeonggwanjang Red Sparks University

790
01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:28.180
The match between Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders

791
01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:32.380
The third set was a 25-18 victory for Jeong Kwan-jang.

792
01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:34.480
The home coach is home

793
01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.780
The crowd is now starting to heat up. That's right. In the third set, Jeong Kwan-jang's attack success rate was 4

794
01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:49.480
It's up to 14.4%. Yes, Lee Sun-woo scored 6 points and Jeon Da-bin and Park Hae-min scored 5 points each. Yes

795
01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.780
In case of Heungkuk Life Insurance, the 3rd generation

796
01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:56.980
At that time, Moon Ji-hoon's 3 points dropped slightly to a 27% success rate.

797
01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:59.780
Kim Da Hoon scored 5 points

798
01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:05.880
The points that used to use a lot of middle blocker lines have significantly decreased.

799
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:09.180
Now, let's start the 4th set game.

800
01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:13.280
Let's win 3 sets and 4 sets

801
01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.320
This is Red Sparks, the home team's director.

802
01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:27.880
There is no significant change in the lineup, and in the case of Heungkuk Life Insurance, Seo Chae-hyun came in first in the fourth set of starting setters. Right.

803
01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:42.240
Seo Chae-hyun is a starter in the fourth set of Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders. Before this match, he only played in one game, and Seo Chae-hyun, who only played in one set

804
01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:53.760
Now, I'll play as a starter in the fourth set. Let's start with Choi Eun-ji. Choi Eun Ji's serve in Korea Life Insurance

805
01:47:54.300 --> 01:48:00.780
From the center to the left, empty

806
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:06.380
First of all, from Heungkuk Life Insurance's point of view, both wings need to be revived.

807
01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:21.200
Yes, Kim Da-eun scored five points in the third set, but it is important not only for Kim Da-hoon, but also for Choi Hyun-ji and Moon Ji-hoon. That was Kim Daeun's score. Lee Sunwoo

808
01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:35.520
Four blocks, Kacha Lee Sun-woo continues to aim at Moon Ji-hoon, but Moon Ji-hoon blocks and shakes little by little. Today, Moon Ji Hoon and Lee Sun Woo

809
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:49.160
It's a scoring match. Yes, Lee Sun-woo is currently 17 points, Moon Ji-hoon 15 points, and Kim Soo-ji and Kim Yeon-kyung are watching the game at Warm Upton.

810
01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:57.360
Play left Kim Daun and Park Tae Min in the center

811
01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:00.300
It's blocked and it's covered with attack.

812
01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:07.700
Choi Yoo-seok under-toss Park Hye-min scores

813
01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:10.780
These players are 4 years old

814
01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:14.880
I haven't done it in full until now

815
01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:22.880
It's just that physical strength and game physical strength are different. Yes, you have to concentrate and have different nerves

816
01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:26.580
There are a lot of things, so it could lead to a decrease in physical strength

817
01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:33.280
That's how much concentration goes down If the rhythm is broken, it could collapse. That's right. Background

818
01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:36.480
And I hit it hard once, but it's effective

819
01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:41.120
Scoring in the center

820
01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:52.860
Create a point. I think the atmosphere of Lee Ji-soo has changed a little. Bringing three sets, Jeong Kwan-jang players can bring a game today

821
01:49:52.940 --> 01:50:02.960
I think I have a hope. The third set was very important. He made a set score of 2 to 1 by catching 3 sets from class president Jung.

822
01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.940
Let me introduce Dabin's serve.

823
01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:19.460
Jeonnam hits the serve hard. Park Soo-hyun received it well and Kim Da-woon is fast forward. Yes, little by little

824
01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:34.380
Kim Da-hoon is also recovering. I hit the straight line accurately. Both teams are showing a lot of monotonous plays right now. Yes

825
01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:43.680
I use wings on both sides a lot. It was Kim Hye Rim's serve. in a swift attack

826
01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:47.600
Choi Eun Ji's defense. Kim Daeun

827
01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:59.120
Yes, I'm moving on. I'm moving on. Heungkuk Life Insurance's second, Kim Dan, this time, and the back 3rd stage is processed again by pushing

828
01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:07.880
This time, it became a right-handed back-to-back defense. And Lee Sunwoo. With consecutive strokes

829
01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:22.140
Even though Moon Ji-hoon's scoring difficulty with the back end, Moon Ji-hoon now overcame it with his strength.

830
01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:25.220
It's Moon Ji-hoon who pushed hard.

831
01:51:25.220 --> 01:51:28.220
This season, Moon Jihoon

832
01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:34.020
Kim Mi-hyun and Kim Mi-hyun have been traded. Right, we changed our uniforms in the middle of the season

833
01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:39.320
Since then, I've been playing Apogit as a main character

834
01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:45.820
I saw a lot of opportunities to play, but recently, I didn't get many opportunities to throw. Yes

835
01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:50.420
Coach Agon Danja, who had an eye on his performance in the 2020 Cup, recruited him

836
01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:52.820
Let's go. Let's get out of here. Do I have to go?

837
01:51:53.400 --> 01:52:02.800
Jeong Kwan-jang's players are saying that they hit the blocker's hand. This is director Ko Hee-jin who requested a video review of whether or not the blocker is touch-out.

838
01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:10.600
Director Jeong's team requested a video review of the blocker touchout.

839
01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:17.700
Park Hae Min's attack

840
01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:28.920
If it had been right, it would have been Moon Ji-hoon, Byun Ji-soo, but it was confirmed as no-touch after reading it. Yes, I decided it wasn't right.

841
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:37.040
If this happens, Park Hae-min's attack is a mistake. Heungkuk Life's score was recognized as it was. Four to three

842
01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:45.460
Lee Hyerim,

843
01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:59.420
Kim Hye-rim's serve is long. Yes, so after this is hard to score with video review, you need to be more careful on the sub.

844
01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:03.540
Maybe it's a rhythm that's taken off. Director Ko Yi-seung asked for the video review

845
01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.280
The score is 4 to 4

846
01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:25.300
It's the same here. Yes, the serve mistakes intersected. Coach Ko Hee-jin's one-point difference continues in the second half of the fourth set. Moon Jihoon's turn to serve

847
01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:29.040
Kim Jiyoon's serve

848
01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:30.780
Let's.

849
01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:41.660
Heungkuk Life Insurance's left side, Kim Daeun, scored Suvei. In the end, Jeonggwanjang's receiving anxiety

850
01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:56.060
It was connected to the dot. That's right. There is also a difference in attack success rate between a set when receiving well and a set when receiving not. Jeon Da-bin couldn't hold his breath while receiving.

851
01:53:56.140 --> 01:54:03.760
Yoon Ji-hoon's serve. This time, Park Hae-min's right Lee Sun-woo is pierced.

852
01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:10.660
Lee Sun-woo is also a player who doesn't lose weight when it comes to strength. Yes.

853
01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:25.060
He keeps hitting hard. Lee Sun-woo, who received the Rookie of the Year award on 2020 season, played 27 games before the game and scored 50 sets 3.

854
01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:38.140
Lee Seong's serve is increasing in the beginning of the fourth set. So if it's four sets, the players' concentration is the least. At the same time, there are a lot of mistakes.

855
01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:50.640
The 5th set is the last set, so I can concentrate better. That's right. I served well. Park Hyemin. Like this

856
01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.960
It's Choi Eun Ji,

857
01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:56.440
Kim Seah, in the center

858
01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:03.900
I raised it high three steps long. Starting with Park Suhyun. Pass painting

859
01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.080
Now, Seo Chaehyun

860
01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:22.340
Park Hye-min was already reading the best painting. Yes, right now, it's okay for Seo Chae-hyun to just take the play with a jump toss. Yes

861
01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:35.920
It was Seo Chae-hyun, who joined as the third-ranked player in the second round last season after graduating from Shownu Girls' High School. Dabin before I push him

862
01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:42.340
It's a defense, and Choi Eun Ji decided to defend

863
01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:48.740
I can't give you any more. Your two players are on the same page

864
01:55:48.920 --> 01:56:03.200
Yes, I'm in charge of it. Noxious blocking Choi Eun Ji's true touch out. Oh, it's touch out. Both teams are making too many mistakes right now.

865
01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:11.240
Choi Eun Ji's attack was successful, but the toss mistakes of the setter position in this connection

866
01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:25.720
In addition, there are a lot of other players' connection mistakes, and I know they're a little less focused, but still, the players are professional players. You have to show responsibility. It was Choi Eun-ji's touchout score.

867
01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:30.140
8

868
01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:36.340
Let's compare Moon Ji-yoon and Lee Sun-woo. Both players get 2 points for blocking

869
01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:41.640
In the open attack, Lee Sun-woo has three more points. There's one more sub-Ace player, Lee Sun-woo.

870
01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:45.840
Moon Jihoon scored 16 points today,

871
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.000
Lee Sun-woo is scoring 19 points. Yes

872
01:56:51.060 --> 01:57:02.100
Moon Ji-hoon scored 16 points, Lee Sun-woo scored 19 points, and Lee Sun-woo is now scoring the most points in both teams. Kim Daeun's rate is actually similar. Yes

873
01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:13.600
Director Chung said, "Three players have a double-digit score score of 8 to 6, with Heungkuk Life leading by 2 points.

874
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:27.060
In the fourth set, Kim Da-won is scoring three points. In Jeonggwanjang, Park Hae-min and Lee Sun-woo are scoring two points each.

875
01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:31.440
8

876
01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:44.260
I'll start with Byun Ji-soo's sub. Byun Ji-soo serves well. It was a serve that was pushed to the back. Darby is good at it

877
01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:52.840
I got an RBI single. As coach Ko Hee-jin, who is applauding Da-bin, the straight course was a little empty.

878
01:57:53.140 --> 01:58:06.960
That's why I won the game strongly. Yes, Heungkuk Life's block conditions are blocking too much straight lines. Jeon Da-bin aimed for this and hit it diagonally well.

879
01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:13.660
The situation that Choi Eun-ji carried a little bit of the fastball rang now

880
01:58:13.740 --> 01:58:18.640
There are also some limitations to the striker's handling. But now

881
01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:22.240
For toss, it was a very difficult ball to handle

882
01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:29.540
In fact, strikers fall a lot and land This is actually no different from the setter's toss fault.

883
01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:34.740
It was a situation that didn't go over. You have requested a reading.

884
01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:40.040
Now, I'm getting a little bit of time after requesting a video review of the point mistakes.

885
01:58:40.040 --> 01:58:44.940
And in this case, Choi Eun Ji's ball hit Bloco's hand

886
01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:47.440
Heungkuk Life is about talking. Yes

887
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:53.440
Then it's a replay. If it hit the blocker line

888
01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:03.240
It's here, but it hits the net, and it hits the block and the hand

889
01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:09.640
If it's gone or not, the point is right.

890
01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:15.240
If you moved on, replay

891
01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:23.140
As a result of the reading, it has been identified as a point. Yes, yes. It's a point mistake. It didn't fit the Block.

892
01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:27.840
Then, it was not replicated and was recognized as Chung's score.

893
01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:31.940
It was Choi Eun-ji's point Bum-sik.

894
01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:41.680
Lee Hae-dam's sub reception is shaking. Park Soo-hyun

895
01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:50.160
Scary ball in the center of Seo Chaewon

896
01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:59.740
There was Jeon Da-min's defense to push this time, which was built again. Back Attack Lee Sung Hoon

897
02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:11.020
So when there is a ball on our side, we have to pay as much attention as possible to reduce the mistakes. If we don't score, the opponent takes that opportunity.

898
02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:18.980
It was Jeong Kwan-jang who connected the score with a good play. Jeong Kwan-jang Lee Seong's score 9 to 8

899
02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:27.000
It's Lee Hae Ram's sub

900
02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:41.440
It was a long time. Both teams are too focused. That's why there are mistakes that you don't have to do.

901
02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:54.460
Seo Chae-hyun is getting ready to serve. Jeon Da-bin and Seo Chae-hyun's serve, with four serve mistakes crossing each other

902
02:00:54.640 --> 02:01:09.100
So what I want to say to these players is that opportunities don't come often. Yes, and you can get a chance in a practice game or a Cobo Cup, but it's really hard to get a chance in this regular season. I'll have to change it.

903
02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:20.160
Seo Chae-hyun is already defending to the right of Tus. You have to do it first. Lee Sungwoo, but I'm mid-relly. Yes

904
02:01:20.420 --> 02:01:33.220
The request for a video review of the defensive success was accepted because the last referee applied before the whistle. This season's newly introduced Heungkuk Life Insurance team is about the failure of Midrelli's defense

905
02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:36.780
You have requested a video review.

906
02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:40.540
director Jeong's

907
02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:55.740
I asked for a video review of whether the defense was successful or not. This pancake defense

908
02:01:55.820 --> 02:02:04.180
Yes, it's this scene. I think I need to watch it. If it didn't fit the coat

909
02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:17.980
If you got a little hit, it's a failure. Yes, so if you look at it from a different angle, you can see the other side. Yes, let's watch this scene here.

910
02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:27.540
During Park Hye-min's defense, this is what happened.

911
02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:41.640
The referee, the referee, and the assistant referee

912
02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:55.260
I'm reading it. In more detail here, head coach Subndaghan confirmed the defensive success as a result of this reading. Yes, if it was confirmed as a successful defense

913
02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:56.900
It's Director Jeong's score.

914
02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:03.820
The score is 11 to 92 points.

915
02:03:04.020 --> 02:03:10.640
First of all, Park Hye-min's good defense made another score. Right.

916
02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:14.040
at 500%

917
02:03:15.420 --> 02:03:26.580
Backers right Moon Ji-hoon and Lee Sun-woo defense... Oh, yes. Park Soo-hyun threw himself and touched it

918
02:03:26.660 --> 02:03:30.760
The connection failed. I'm sure that Heungkuk Life's players are

919
02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:35.860
The overall movement has slowed down a little since the third set. I think so.

920
02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:42.560
The defensive players and strikers fell a little bit.

921
02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.620
Park Hae-jin is back. The score is 1 and the difference is 3 points

922
02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:54.820
The completion was done well. a white tiger

923
02:03:57.580 --> 02:04:07.200
Lee Sun-woo's defense is on the right side of Korea Life Insurance Choi Eun-ji's straight line

924
02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:20.880
It's a mistake. Jeon said, "I got hit by Bloco," but I'm Coach Gois who is asking for a video review. Jeon Da Min's attack

925
02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:23.660
There was a request. I don't know if I got hit or not

926
02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:35.720
It's a drawing card. Oh, I see. Lim Hye-rim raised her hand. I acknowledged it. Yes, Jeon Da Bin's attack score

927
02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.980
The green card came out that he hit Lee Hye-rim's hand and left.

928
02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:56.080
I'm Avon Danza, the director who is requesting an operation time at 13:9.

929
02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:38.300
I'm manager Avnanja, who is emphasizing more about organizational power to the players. Director Jung has scored four consecutive points from 10 to 13. That's right.

930
02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:45.060
Now, Heungkuk Life Insurance's concentration has been shaken a lot in the meantime.

931
02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:48.720
I saved it by moving on to the singland toss.

932
02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:56.480
Moon Ji-hoon's right Moon Ji-hoon line came in. Yes, I'm in the scoring line.

933
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.420
It falls inwards.

934
02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:01.760
Yes

935
02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:16.880
Coach Ko Hee-jin was a little worried because the rotation of the ball was on the outside at the end. I pushed a long score to the 5th position. On this line

936
02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:17.460
Scoring points

937
02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:30.800
Now, Lee Sun-woo is scoring a lot of points. This is Lee Sun-woo, who has already scored 22 points. I'm Lee Sun-woo, who has the most points among both teams.

938
02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.940
14

939
02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:43.700
Jeon Dabin's serve

940
02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:48.740
Right Lee Sunwoo

941
02:06:48.880 --> 02:07:01.520
The gap between the four points is widening rapidly. The atmosphere of 15 to 10 to 12 sets and the atmosphere of 34 sets are so different between the two teams. I think so.

942
02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:16.560
Lee Sun-woo has scored 23 points. The margin was 15 to 15 points. And I'm getting ready to serve.

943
02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:24.900
The answer is "Seon-Gra". It's on the right

944
02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:26.620
I like them all

945
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.080
It's stuck again.

946
02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:45.620
It's Lee Ji-soo's blocking score from the right. It was Lee Chae-min's attempt to attack, but this was blocked by Lee Ji-soo. Lee Chae Min, Nay Ji-Soo's blocking score

947
02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:52.340
The score is 16 to 10 by 6 points

948
02:07:52.420 --> 02:08:06.300
Cross attack blocked. Lee Chae-min and Lee Ji-soo's blocking score. But today, Lee Chae-min got a chance to step on the court for the first time in a long time, and he's also touching a lot of arts.

949
02:08:06.380 --> 02:08:17.660
But I need to score some points now This is the first game for Lee Chae-min. That's right. Yes, Chaemin Lee, who is playing his v-League debut game, has no goals so far. Yes

950
02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:20.320
The score is 16 to 106 points

951
02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:31.400
Lee Sun-woo scored 23 points and Moon Ji-hoon scored 17 points. In Jeonggwanjang, Jeon Da Bin and Park Hae Min

952
02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:46.000
In the previous round, Lee Seo-won scored 1211 points, and Kim Dae-eun scored 14 points in the current life, so the wing striker should score some points in Heungkuk Life. That's right. Kim Daeun is now

953
02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:59.840
Choi Eun-ji's score is tied to 7 points. Yes, 16 to 10 Dabin's serve continues.

954
02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:10.100
Kim Da-hoon, this is included, too. Video Referee Video Referee Video Referee Request

955
02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:13.840
There is an in-out reading request from the referee.

956
02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:22.600
Kim Da-hoon's attack requested a video review of the in-out by the referee.

957
02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:38.500
If you see the inner line when the maximum pressure of the hole is applied, yes, it's here. Yes, if you see it, you're out.

958
02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:50.000
The reading confirmed that it was out. Yes, it came out. I saw the inside hand. And Kim Daeun's offense is 17 to 107 points

959
02:09:50.080 --> 02:10:00.060
At some point, the success rate of the three strikers continues to decline, as well as the team as a whole. Yes

960
02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:13.340
Fighting! Jeon Damin's sub, Park Su-hyun. This speed. When Heungkuk Life goes well with the set, it's a picnic like this

961
02:10:13.420 --> 02:10:23.640
You scored a lot. Lee Hye-rim and Byun Ji-soo showed a lot of non-kick and mobile attack plays, but they slowed down a little from the third set.

962
02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:30.760
Lim Hye-rim succeeded in masonry with Lee Ji-soo in front of her. Lim Hye-rim

963
02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:43.340
17

964
02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:58.060
It's Lee Sun-woo, who is scoring 24 points right now. Yes, Lee Sun-woo's highest score in a single game is 27 points. Yes, we have 3 points left. That's right.

965
02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:15.180
Oh, it's A.C.E. Now, the game leans sharply toward the articles of association. Shin Eun Ji's serve ace

966
02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:20.000
19th serve score this season. Yes

967
02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:21.780
Shin Eun Ji

968
02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:30.220
It was good to take the course It's very good that Shin Eun-ji usually pushes it to the end line. I'm getting netted right now

969
02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:38.720
Last Pro Kim Down Flocking Scorer Twenty to Ten Scores Big Difference. Yes

970
02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:49.580
Now, this is Lee Sunwoo's three blocks. Since Lee Sunwoo has 2 points on the back and 2 points on the serve

971
02:11:49.660 --> 02:12:03.140
In fact, if you set your mind to it, you can achieve triple crunches. Eunji continues to prepare for serve by a score of 20 to 119.

972
02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:06.440
Short

973
02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:15.200
Blocking up on the right, Lee Sunwoo

974
02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:27.840
It came out. Yes, yes. I hit it at an acute angle, but it's going out. Since Lee Sun-woo has found the belief in the attack, he has added confidence to the attack and his expression has definitely brightened up. That's right.

975
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:42.600
Obviously, the success rate of scoring increases, so the players' facial expressions become very bright. 1, 2, 3. Heungkuk Life's Lee Chaemin's serve

976
02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:56.520
Ethos right Lee Sunwoo is not rough. I think Lee Sun-woo will be able to break his personal record in today's game. Yes

977
02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:11.300
He is now playing the role of director Jeong's ace. The score was 21 to 129 points. Should I be greedy to serve? Triple-cropped. Yes

978
02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:15.700
It came over right away. Back-up tie

979
02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:17.380
I'm unemployed

980
02:13:18.740 --> 02:13:33.500
Lee Sun-woo's rear-end attack has been recorded three times, so we just need to serve one more time. I'm Lee Sunwoo with sub Ara left until Triple Crown. Yes

981
02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:36.140
Lee Sun-mi's Tugertech

982
02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:50.080
There is a big gap between the two teams in the fourth set.

983
02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:17.760
Now, the strikers said not to just hit me normally, but to show me some angles or other techniques using blocking.

984
02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:27.880
The score is very wide open. a situation in which a margin of ten points was reached. Kim Yeon-koung looks more tired now than when she was on the court

985
02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:36.440
Yes, it's a chance to score once again. Park Tae-min with a time difference between the articles of association

986
02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:44.080
Park Hae-jin's heretical defeat succeeded in Spain

987
02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:48.080
It's hard to put the ball up to the striker

988
02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:55.380
When you look at the empty space for sure, it's good to solve it yourself. Yes, I handed it over with my left hand.

989
02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:58.980
persecuted

990
02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:02.580
It was a goal. It didn't fit my hand.

991
02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:09.480
It didn't come over. It's Lee Song Min. It's Lee Song Min's first appearance today

992
02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:11.580
I guess I was too nervous.

993
02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:16.180
I'm a middle blocker who graduated from Men's Girls' High School. This season's rookie round 2, round 3

994
02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:21.500
I joined in the rankings and I'm playing my v-League debut match professional debut match today.

995
02:15:21.640 --> 02:15:29.800
It was a defensive back. Yes, Lee Sungmin was the second

996
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:42.580
Because there is, we catch so-called attacks. Yes, you can't step on the attack line and jump. So, it's 24 to 13 as a set point

997
02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:46.000
The director's face is really stiff. Short

998
02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:58.300
It became a free business. Baek Geotech's Lee Sun-woo's defense will not be able to finish it. 25 to 13

999
02:15:58.380 --> 02:16:12.340
There was a little difference in score for this 4th set. First of all, Lee Sun-hoon is continuously showing good performance. Heungkuk Life lost a lot of concentration after about three sets. Yes

1000
02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:13.860
Set score vs

1001
02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:21.680
The counterattack of the late leader is now moving on to the 5th set. It's Daejeon.

1002
02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:26.800
Who wins this taste? Show us the Shanghai burger taste

1003
02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:32.620
It's a Shanghai burger that's crispier with rice flour and spicy cream noodle Toowoomba sauce

1004
02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:37.300
Who can beat this taste? Max Paci Shanghai Toowoomba

1005
02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:52.320
People who have tried it say. Differences in ingredients make a difference in effectiveness. Swelling and bleeding gum disease changes the gums with four components. It's Gattan for gum disease

1006
02:16:52.580 --> 02:17:07.440
Sketchers comfort is powerful. You make me who is always ready and who continues to challenge myself for a long time. With the power of comfort, Sketchers hands-free, Slivins

1007
02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:21.240
Crumble-coated, crunchy and crispy. 60 delicious chicken kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

1008
02:17:51.360 --> 02:18:01.900
It's Chungmu Gymnasium in Daejeon. Dodram 2024 2025 Season V-League Women's 6th Round Director Jung Red Spark Era Heungkuk Life Pink Spider Ski's 4 Set 25:15

1009
02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:08.280
It was a complete victory for Director Jeong. The two teams showed a big difference in attack success rate. Blocking serve

1010
02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:15.780
In every aspect, the articles of association showed that they were ahead of them. When it comes to mistakes, Heungkuk Life had three more. Yes

1011
02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:20.380
Heungkuk Life won the 5th set, the 1st and 2nd set, and the 34th set

1012
02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:22.380
Director Jeong got it. Now

1013
02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:26.880
The 5th set of fate... These players

1014
02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:31.280
In the case of Heungkuk Life Insurance, it's a game that doesn't affect the ranking right now

1015
02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:38.180
In the case of Director Jeong, it is still a game that is reflected in the ranking. That's right. I'm Jeong Kwan-jang, who is fighting this fight right now. That's right.

1016
02:18:38.180 --> 02:18:40.480
If we win today's game

1017
02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:42.980
It brings benefits to Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction

1018
02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:45.380
with three points

1019
02:18:45.380 --> 02:18:48.380
It's the articles of association that can bring about results. Yes

1020
02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:52.980
Director Jung is strong at home games

1021
02:18:52.980 --> 02:18:58.180
It's the most advantageous situation to come in second place. That's right. Playoffs

1022
02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:04.180
It's Jeong Kwan-jang, and the 2nd place team will play the first round

1023
02:19:04.180 --> 02:19:07.680
From Chung's point of view, the first round of the playoffs

1024
02:19:07.680 --> 02:19:13.480
You'll want to do it in Daejeon. Jung has played 15 regular league games so far in this match

1025
02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:19.680
I won 10 times. The winning rate is 66%. That's right. On the other hand

1026
02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:23.480
Suwon's away game is one win and one loss. I won once and lost once.

1027
02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:26.380
66% to 50% based on figures alone

1028
02:19:26.380 --> 02:19:30.180
That's right. Lee Sunwoo is now 27

1029
02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:34.380
I'm scoring, but I scored 10 points in the fourth set alone.

1030
02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:39.080
I'm almost done. That's right. And now, we're in Triple Crown

1031
02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:41.780
There is only one serve left.

1032
02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:50.380
The scoring streak continues.

1033
02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:56.280
Last season, Lee Sun-woo played against Pepper Savings Bank

1034
02:19:56.280 --> 02:20:03.780
After excluding all the main players, Lee Sunwoo played the ace role

1035
02:20:03.780 --> 02:20:10.080
He scored 7 points. That's right. Today, we exceeded that record beyond that game.

1036
02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:12.380
I was Dabin's serve.

1037
02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:22.520
Baek's right-handed score, Moon Ji-hoon, in the same position as Lee Sun-woo and Moon Ji-hoon

1038
02:20:22.600 --> 02:20:37.140
I think the scoring competition will also be a point to watch. Yes, Moon Ji-hoon and Lee Sun-woo are in charge of the afford without foreign players from both teams today. Backtos right Lee Sunwoo

1039
02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:44.980
Jung Kwan-jang and Park Tae-min are on the right side of Moon Ji-hoon

1040
02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:55.660
A mistake. Now it's not a mistake of connection, but Park Hye-min just came down with an RBI single and hit it. Yes.

1041
02:20:55.780 --> 02:21:06.800
Yes, I think it should be seen as the striker's fault. It's five sets, but the players need to be more calm and calm, but I passed it for now. Oh, it overlapped.

1042
02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:20.100
Ji Ji Ji-hoon, this led to a score. Moon Ji-hoon had no choice but to turn the ball over. Then Jeong Kwan-jang's defenders don't have to put their legs together. Yes

1043
02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:31.220
This is the only thing Moon Ji-hoon can do right now. That's right. We had to play a little forward defense because we couldn't spike. You caught him. Side blue

1044
02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:36.720
Why do you keep making straight lines come out

1045
02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:53.600
Coach Ko Hee-jin also has to raise his voice a little bit because he did so well in the 3rd and 4th sets, but now he's showing a little lack of concentration in the 5th set. Yes

1046
02:21:53.680 --> 02:22:01.500
Now we have more orders. In the 5th set, the initial atmosphere is very important.

1047
02:22:02.380 --> 02:22:04.860
3

1048
02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:19.640
Heungkuk Life's Tae Eun Ji's serve, ice serve, ace

1049
02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:24.720
Director Jeong Ji-Soo participated in the program

1050
02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:28.720
I jumped like this. Choi Eunjin's serve

1051
02:22:28.720 --> 02:22:32.820
It shook the receivers' timing as it deflected off.

1052
02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:37.480
4

1053
02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:48.660
Park Tae-min is in defense. I handed it over to Park Tae-min. Choi Hyo-seok, Backus, right Lee Sung-woo. Yes

1054
02:22:48.740 --> 02:22:54.820
Lee Sun-woo's offensive condition is getting better. If you do this, you'll be able to score 30 points in front of your eyes

1055
02:22:54.900 --> 02:23:09.600
It's Lee Sunwoo who's doing it. He is currently scoring 29 points. He's exceeded his career high. That's right. This is Lee Sun-woo, who broke the record from 27 points to 209. Four to two

1056
02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:22.160
Scoring with reason at the Undertoss Olympics in a short time

1057
02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:24.520
Lee Sunwoo hits

1058
02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:37.340
It's leading to a footy score. In the first set, Lee Sun-woo scored only four points, but he continued to accumulate points, and he is already scoring 30 points. Yes

1059
02:23:37.620 --> 02:23:43.780
4

1060
02:23:47.300 --> 02:23:57.160
Shin Eun Ji's serve is a good one and she went into the sideline well. Right

1061
02:23:57.320 --> 02:24:10.420
Oh, it's Lee Hae-dam's blocking score. If you do this, you have a tie block. Moon Jihoon is blocked. Lee Hae-dam's tie blocking

1062
02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:21.300
Yes, I got caught in Lee Hae-dam's right hand. Moon Jiyoon, a block game that makes it 4 to 4 tie

1063
02:24:21.380 --> 02:24:36.240
Kim Ji-hoon attacked in a situation where he was carrying a little. That's right. Lee Hae-dam has three points right now. He caught two blocks alone.

1064
02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:50.660
It was an operation time request from director Avnanza. First of all, the players that came in right now

1065
02:24:50.740 --> 02:25:02.800
When you analyze it, there are no players who have a lot of data. That's right. Players have to play volleyball that is completely faithful to their personal skills and basics. Lee Sunwoo scored 30 points today

1066
02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:16.820
But now it was Shin Eun-jin's fault. But you want to bring good results. Of course. From Heungkuk Life, Kim Hyunkyung

1067
02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:28.300
With Kim Hyun-kyung coming in, the atmosphere of the stadium changes. Kim Hyun-kyung is here. Kim Yeonkyung is preparing to serve. In fact, so many people are here

1068
02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:43.500
In a way, they're all here to see Kim Hyun-kyung's play. That's right. Kim Hyun-kyung, who is getting angry, came into the 5th set for the first time. With Jaheungguk Life leading 5 to 4, Kim Hyun-kyung serves

1069
02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:44.340
the left

1070
02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:52.360
I'm in defense. Lee Sunwoo on the right. Lee Sunwoo

1071
02:25:53.440 --> 02:26:04.200
He's out. Yes, he's out. It's a mistake. I'm going to request Lee Sunhee's video review I see.

1072
02:26:05.700 --> 02:26:13.440
Now, I requested a video review. The articles of association team requested a video review of the blocker touchout.

1073
02:26:19.160 --> 02:26:33.440
It's Lee Sun-woo, who was aiming for a straight line, but Kim Da-hoon put his hands inside. As a result of the at-bat, it was confirmed as no touch. Yes, it's 6 to 4

1074
02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:35.620
Heungkuk Life is ahead of this point.

1075
02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:40.520
Kim Yeon-koung's serve will continue.

1076
02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:50.380
Now, Kim Hyun-kyung's goal toward Da-bin before that was defended by time difference.

1077
02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:58.960
Starting with Eun Ji-ho and Tae-ho on the right, Lee Sun-woo hit well on the right. Huh Chang-ho

1078
02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:07.080
I'm Lee Sunwoo, who showed off his technique of pushing the ball further than any other angle. Yes

1079
02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:20.680
Yes, he is leading the articles of association well. Yes, it's six to five. And Kim Yeon-koung is out. Yes

1080
02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:30.080
There were also a lot of away fans from Heungkuk Life. That's right. I hit Lee Sunhee's serve and scored

1081
02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:41.620
7

1082
02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:48.420
There's no time to blame now. That's how I solved it.

1083
02:27:48.700 --> 02:28:03.360
Because it was short, I could only see that angle. Kim Hyun-kyung served twice and went back into the warm-up zone. Yes, in fact, the main players are not playing today, so I came in as a fan service.

1084
02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:11.240
From the left side of Korea Life Insurance's Kim Da Soles Ab Choi Hyo-sung

1085
02:28:11.360 --> 02:28:12.540
persecuted people

1086
02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:23.680
I pushed it. I'm out. It's a mistake. Kim Daeun's offense is 7 to 6

1087
02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:38.620
Heungkuk Life's strikers should be determined to find and deal with the ball rather than expecting it to come normally.

1088
02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:41.840
Behind the sub of Jeonggwanjang Park Hae Min

1089
02:28:42.100 --> 02:28:51.220
I'm a little nervous about my defense. Park Hyemin is right. Ahn Yerim

1090
02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:55.520
I hit the block and it bounced off.

1091
02:28:56.500 --> 02:28:58.960
Kim Daeun is stuck

1092
02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:04.440
This time, I'm an expletive

1093
02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:07.200
You hit me well. It's a score.

1094
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:17.700
I'm Dabin who boldly took the swing. Exclusive Spike Of Jeon Dabin 7 To 7

1095
02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:30.180
The straight line was a little empty. Yes, Park Hae-jin looked very disappointed. This season's rookie, Jeon Dabin. 7:7 and this season's rookie

1096
02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:38.540
The competition is very fierce. That's right. Jeon Da-bin is also on the list. Nishif is exactly right

1097
02:29:38.620 --> 02:29:41.120
So this is all

1098
02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:47.120
It's a toss mistake. There are a lot of mistakes that come from his teamwork with Park Hae Jin

1099
02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:51.720
The strikers seem to be losing timing and having a hard time.

1100
02:29:51.720 --> 02:29:56.220
It's 8 to 7. Director Jeong leads by 1 point and changes the court

1101
02:29:56.220 --> 02:30:03.420
From now on, it's really a battle of concentration.

1102
02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:10.020
Kim Hyun-kyung came into the fifth set and made two serves.

1103
02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:14.320
Kim Hyunkyung's

1104
02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:18.720
The leadership on the court is really great, actually

1105
02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:24.860
It's comparable to anyone in the world

1106
02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:32.100
That's what Kim Yeon-koung did. Straight line

1107
02:30:33.300 --> 02:30:35.180
Slowly connect

1108
02:30:35.620 --> 02:30:42.220
Okay, I've done it in three levels. Yes, yes, heresy pass penking

1109
02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:55.100
First of all, Heungkuk Life is playing time, but the players' movements are a little different from what manager Avonja says.

1110
02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:35.660
Hanja is also a coach who has a great passion for victory. That's right. Even though we're on top of the regular league, the players are very

1111
02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:47.660
You're strongly encouraging it. In fact, Heungkuk Life has a more important game ahead of it. We're about to have a championship game, and these players have to play a good role then. Right.

1112
02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:54.560
Left speed ball. Correct.

1113
02:31:54.860 --> 02:32:08.280
Kim Daeun's ball point per hour was a little low. It was low, but now Kim Daeun has handled it well. Yes, yes, yes, yes

1114
02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:10.180
It was Kim Daeun's score.

1115
02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:15.920
When the coaches of both teams look at their faces

1116
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:28.860
There are a few complaints. Yes, if the players feel like they're trying to win again, it's going to take a lot of strength. Except for Daeun's falling serve, Tae

1117
02:32:29.180 --> 02:32:42.160
Point Lee Sun-woo pipe attack worked. Today, Lee Sun-woo is playing the game of his life.

1118
02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:49.620
He's scoring the most points since he came into the professional league. The score is 10 to 8 with the success of the pipe of reason

1119
02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:58.620
And Jeong Suji is ready to serve. Jeong Su-ji's serve

1120
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:07.220
Success from the right. Heungkuk Life Insurance players are doing their best until the end. Yes

1121
02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:12.260
Successful move attack by local man.

1122
02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:17.740
Yes, as Lim Hye-rim entered, Kim Yeon-kyung came out again.

1123
02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:30.420
Each movement of Kim Yeon-koung changes the reaction of these spectators. That's what I'm saying. Ten to nine

1124
02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:33.360
Now, push it

1125
02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:36.460
It's stuck behind me

1126
02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:39.160
Now, push it

1127
02:33:39.340 --> 02:33:52.180
The left forerunner is crossed over. I didn't get hit by the fact and moved on. Right? Yes

1128
02:33:52.260 --> 02:34:01.200
It's a request that Moon Ji-hoon stepped on the line when he tried to attack the rear. That was a foul on the rear attacker. Yes

1129
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:10.840
It's not a request, but the referee has already decided so. Moon Ji-hoon stepped on the voluntary attack line of the rear attack.

1130
02:34:11.240 --> 02:34:24.480
The score is blocked by Heungkuk Life Insurance's Choi Eun-ji, whose issue is shaken by an 11-to-92 score difference. Blocking Scoring Articles of Incorporation

1131
02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:38.880
12

1132
02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:41.480
22

1133
02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:56.200
Before today's game, there were two blocked points. That's right. Choi Eun Ji has pierced the relationship well now. First of all, Choi Eun-ji put out the urgent light. 12 to 10

1134
02:34:56.420 --> 02:35:07.820
If you get two points, you can get enough points. That's right. Even the articles of association can't be reassured. Choi Hyun-ji scored even in an anxious position.

1135
02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:15.960
From the outside, Lee Sunwoo

1136
02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:19.240
Choi Eun Ji

1137
02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:23.720
It's blocked. Once again, rub your finger to the right

1138
02:35:25.340 --> 02:35:29.080
It's a mistake. Lee Hyerim

1139
02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:41.380
I put my hand on it, but it's out. I tried to do it in a hurry, so the timing wasn't right. I did under my eyes, but I have to roll it up from the top

1140
02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:55.280
Jeong Kwan Jang Jeon Dabin's serve that made 13 points

1141
02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:59.920
As expected, Choi Eun Ji

1142
02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:13.000
Now I think Choi Eun-ji's score is a little late, but she is now scoring 10 points. It was Choi Eun-ji, who has now scored double digits.

1143
02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:23.240
Still, in the end, both teams now have the most points scored by both wing strikers.

1144
02:36:23.660 --> 02:36:36.000
Well, Nishi-Bi is shaking a lot. Blocked and scored from the left side Park Hae-min, then it's a match point.

1145
02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:50.680
Even after giving up 12 sets, Director Jung seems to be gaining strength from the third set. That's what I'm saying. If Jung wins, he will get 2 points

1146
02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:58.700
You will reach 60 points first. It can widen the point gap with Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction by three points.

1147
02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:05.720
Is it out of the way? It's out of the way. Kim Daeun's attack, Jeong Sang, set score

1148
02:37:05.860 --> 02:37:20.060
3

1149
02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:21.320
on the dot

1150
02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:31.100
He recorded 3 sub-serves blocking with 43% attack success rate. Yes, it was today's game where Lee Sun-woo did a great job.

1151
02:37:31.100 --> 02:37:33.600
Director Jeong scored 3 to 2

1152
02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.700
We came from behind to win.

1153
02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:45.000
First of all, it will be a three-point difference that won the game to widen the score gap with Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction. Right.

1154
02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.200
Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction has won three games in a row

1155
02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:55.200
Wi-Fi is also an injury. That's right. Recently, Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction is showing a strategy to remove a large number of key players

1156
02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:57.300
There's still a game between the two teams

1157
02:37:57.300 --> 02:38:01.500
Yes, the game between Chung and Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction will be held on March 9th

1158
02:38:01.500 --> 02:38:05.600
I think some rankings will be confirmed in this game. Yes

1159
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:09.400
The director is

1160
02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:12.400
3

1161
02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:14.800
Despite the music, I lowered it from the third set

1162
02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:19.880
He won three sets and won three to two.

1163
02:38:20.300 --> 02:38:34.240
Director Jeong lost points. Now it was Director Jeong who stepped on the 60-point mark. Regardless of whether we win or lose today's game, Heungkuk Life Insurance has won first place in the regular league

1164
02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:45.700
He's preparing for the regular league championship ceremony. Yes, that's why Heungkuk Life gave the main players a break

1165
02:38:45.780 --> 02:38:48.980
In fact, Heungkuk Life Insurance played in the previous game

1166
02:38:48.980 --> 02:38:53.680
Jung couldn't add more points

1167
02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:59.980
In the absence of a game, the top spot in the regular league was confirmed. To GS Caltex

1168
02:38:59.980 --> 02:39:02.640
I didn't get a point anymore

1169
02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:16.880
Heungkuk Life Insurance, who confirmed the top spot in the regular league. The players of both teams are intersecting with each other. Yes, the interview with Kim Yeon-koung

1170
02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:23.260
It's getting ready. Can you hear Kim Hyun-kyung well? Yes, hello Hello. Yes, yes

1171
02:39:23.340 --> 02:39:34.800
Regardless of the result of the game, we're going to have an interview about the first place in the regular league, but you didn't participate today Yes, that's right. That's right

1172
02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:41.680
However, please tell us how you feel about winning the 1st place in the regular league. To be honest, first place in the regular league

1173
02:39:41.680 --> 02:39:44.680
I'm so happy to be able to do it

1174
02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:48.680
There were a lot of difficulties during the season

1175
02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:52.580
We were able to confirm the regular league quickly

1176
02:39:52.580 --> 02:39:55.180
I feel so much better. So

1177
02:39:55.180 --> 02:40:00.480
I'm happy that I won the regular league, but I still have the championship game left

1178
02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:03.680
We will finish well until the championship so that we can finish with a unified championship.

1179
02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:07.380
I think there will be a lot of challenges

1180
02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:17.480
If you had the most memorable moment of crisis, what would it have been? As a foreign player got injured

1181
02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:20.180
I overcame that moment well

1182
02:40:20.180 --> 02:40:22.880
I'm going to hurry up and confirm it

1183
02:40:22.880 --> 02:40:27.680
I think I could've lost. So, the players

1184
02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:32.980
I think we were united. And as the team got stronger, we were able to

1185
02:40:32.980 --> 02:40:35.280
I think I was able to even win the regular league.

1186
02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:38.180
After Kim Yeon-koung returned to the v-League

1187
02:40:38.180 --> 02:40:42.280
I've won first place in the regular league

1188
02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:45.680
There's no championship game

1189
02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:54.080
I'm also curious about the degree of aspiration. Yes, there is a championship. It's funny, but after I came back, the victory

1190
02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:58.180
I always had a lot of regrets because I didn't have one. And

1191
02:40:58.180 --> 02:41:02.700
Well, I always

1192
02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:10.980
I was always satisfied that I went to the finals while playing in Korea, but this time, since it's the end

1193
02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:14.160
I think I want to finish with a unified championship.

1194
02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:18.660
We won the MVP award in the 5th round

1195
02:41:18.660 --> 02:41:23.360
I think he's the most MVP in the round

1196
02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:26.160
How do you feel about that?

1197
02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:29.560
Well, first of all

1198
02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:32.360
Yes, that's good. Yes, that's good

1199
02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:38.260
The reason why I won the MVP award was because my team members worked so hard

1200
02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:41.060
I was able to do that. I'm so thankful to my team members

1201
02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:45.160
And we were able to get good results

1202
02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:49.060
I think those things were possible because there were team members and staff.

1203
02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:53.260
Yes, I'm meeting with Kim Hyun-kyung.

1204
02:41:53.260 --> 02:42:00.160
Many fans are now regretting Kim Yeon-koung's retirement. Oppa players told me not to go

1205
02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:04.060
I did. Your whole volleyball life

1206
02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:09.060
We still have a lot of games left, but when you look back on the whole game, the most impressive game

1207
02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:16.860
I have a sense of foresight, but can I ask you in advance? Oh, there are so many things. I don't think it's easy to pick one.

1208
02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:24.260
I think the national team games are the most memorable. The Olympic games and big competitions are the most memorable

1209
02:42:24.260 --> 02:42:30.560
There are a lot of games left. There are a lot of games left

1210
02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:34.060
Don't think emotionally and wrap it up well

1211
02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:37.360
so that I can do it

1212
02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:42.060
I think I need to do it. Heungkuk Life Insurance's regular league

1213
02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:44.160
It's the last game in Daejeon.

1214
02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:57.360
In the case of Kim Yeon-kyung, there is still a championship game left in the future, but you don't know what will happen. That's right. You may never be able to come to Daejeon again. That's right. Please say something to the fans in Daejeon. Yes, so today

1215
02:42:57.360 --> 02:43:00.560
Even when I'm not warmed up, the director

1216
02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:06.660
Since it could be the last match for you, I stepped on the court

1217
02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:10.960
I think it was good. And today, a lot of spectators

1218
02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:13.360
Even though I couldn't run in the front

1219
02:43:13.360 --> 02:43:15.760
Thank you so much for your support

1220
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:19.260
We have more games to play, so we'll do our best

1221
02:43:19.260 --> 02:43:21.560
I'll show it to you. Thank you.

1222
02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:25.760
Yes, it was Kim Yeon-koung. Thank you. Thank you. Yes

1223
02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:30.960
Jadodram 2024 2025 Season V League Women's 6th Round Jeonggwanjang Red Sparks De

1224
02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:33.160
I'm the director of Gyeonggi Chung of Heungkuk Life Pink Spiders

1225
02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:36.560
3

1226
02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:39.160
We've been with commentator Han Yu-mi. This is

1227
02:43:39.160 --> 02:43:44.600
This is Daejeon Jeongjeong Gymnasium. My self

1228
02:43:44.860 --> 02:43:55.440
It was thrown away in a broken state. Remember the knots and the passage of time left forever.

1229
02:44:10.300 --> 02:44:11.860
I didn't want it

1230
02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:17.060
as if to greet someone in the end

1231
02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:20.080
a burst of tears

1232
02:44:25.360 --> 02:44:29.860
I forgot about the warm promise.

1233
02:44:33.540 --> 02:44:35.420
a strong wind

1234
